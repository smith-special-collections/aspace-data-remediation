        <p>Julia Miles founded the Women's Theatre Project (WPP) at the American Place Theatre in 1978 with a grant from the Ford Foundation.  Its purpose was to identify and nurture the work of women playwrights and directors. The group produced rehearsed readings, studio productions, and, in a few cases, main-stage productions for the American Place Theatre. Such performers as Colleen Dewhurst, Tammy Grimes, Linda Hunt, and Carrie Nye have supported the program. In eight seasons, the Project presented 150 scripts as rehearsed readings, produced 35 plays, and published two anthologies of plays written by WPP members. The WPP exists to bring women directors together with a playwright, a stage, and actors. Efforts have been successful: Joan Micklin-Silver, Ellie Renfield, Amy Saltz, Joan Van Thorne, Claudia Weill, Bryna Wortman, and many other directors have worked in the Project.</p>
