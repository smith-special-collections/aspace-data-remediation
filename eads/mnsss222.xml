       <p>Jessie Haver Butler was born on Pueblo, Colorado cattle ranch in 1886.  She
received an A.B. from Smith College in 1909.  She was secretary and assistant Director of
New York City's Pulitzer School of Journalism, and from 1917-18, she was secretary and
lobbyist for the National Consumers League. Butler lobbied for minimum wage for women in
industry. She was a legislative advocate for the League of Women Voters in 1919, and in 1918
and 1919, she accompanied Carrie Chapman Catt on a cross-country lecture trip for suffrage.
In 1920, she married Hugh Butler.  In the 1920s, she lived in London, where she studied
public speaking and lectured to women's groups. She also underwent psychoanalysis with the
first Jungian Clinic Psychoanalyst in Europe, James Hadfield.  In the 1930s and 40s, she
taught public speaking to wives of congressmen and diplomats in Washington, D.C., and she
wrote 3 books on public speaking. In the 1950s, she organized a League of Women Voters
chapter in Pomona, California. She was active in the National Organization for Women, and
she helped to establish daycare centers in Pomona in the 1970s. She was interested in
religion and the "Community Church." Butler died in 1985.</p>
