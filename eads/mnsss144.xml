         <p>Carrie Lane Chapman Catt was born on January 9, 1859 in
    Ripon, Wisconsin, the second of three children of Lucius Lane
    and Maria Clinton. When Carrie was seven years old the family
    moved to Charles City, Iowa, where she spent the rest of her
    childhood. She taught at a country school until she saved
    enough money to pay for college, and entered Iowa State
    College in 1877. In 1880, following her graduation, she
    studied law before becoming principal of the high school in
    Mason City, Iowa. She later became the first female
    superintendent of the district.</p>
         <p>In 1885, Catt married Leo Chapman, editor-owner of the
    Mason City Republican, which she helped him manage. Following
    his death in 1886, she was employed in the newspaper business
    in San Francisco, where she became increasingly aware of the
    inequalities facing women in the business and industrial
    arenas. Leaving San Francisco less than a year later, she
    returned to Iowa where she began lecturing on the status of
    women in the United States. Catt was convinced that women's
    inequality was based on their lack of political power, and
    she focused her efforts on women's suffrage. She joined the
    Iowa Woman Suffrage Association and was elected State
    Organizer in 1887. In 1890 she was invited to address the
    convention of the National American Woman Suffrage
    Association (NAWSA) in Washington, D.C., where she met
    important suffrage activists, among them Susan B. Anthony,
    Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Julia Ward Howe. Following the
    convention, she married George W. Catt, a successful
    hydraulic engineer. When Susan B. Anthony retired as
    president of NAWSA in 1900, she named Catt her successor.
    Catt used her position to forge new alliances with women
    across the world, calling an international suffrage
    conference in 1902. The conference was attended by
    representatives from nine countries and led to the founding
    of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance. By the time
    Catt retired as president of NAWSA twenty-one years later,
    forty countries had branches of the International Woman
    Suffrage Alliance and twenty of these had enfranchised women
    fully.</p>
         <p>After 1904, when she was forced to step down from the
    NAWSA presidency because of her husband's poor health, Catt
    turned her attention to achieving suffrage in New York State,
    which she felt was critical to passage of a federal suffrage
    amendment. Due largely to her efforts, which included
    consolidating disparate city groups into the Woman Suffrage
    Party (1910), and organizing and chairing the Empire State
    Campaign (1913-14), in 1917 the New York State Legislature
    finally passed a referendum granting women the right to
    vote.</p>
         <p>From this point, the struggle for national women's
    suffrage became more intense and Catt was an increasingly
    charismatic symbol of the movement. During World War One she
    was asked to take on the presidency of NAWSA once again, in
    part to facilitate keeping the idea of women's suffrage in
    the forefront of American politics. As a member of the
    Woman's Division of the Council for National Defense, she was
    able to push Congress to submit the Nineteenth Amendment in
    June of 1919, and on August 26, 1920, the federal amendment
    granting women's suffrage was signed into law. After suffrage
    was won, Catt founded the National League of Women Voters to
    help newly-enfranchised women navigate the election
    process.</p>
         <p>Throughout the rest of her life, Catt worked tirelessly
    for pacifism, disarmament, and the peaceful settlement of
    international disputes, most notably by attempting to create
    a common international program of peace. In 1925, she invited
    international women's organizations to work together to form
    a disarmament program at the First Conference on the Cause
    and Cure of War in Washington, D.C. At this conference, a
    permanent Committee on the Cause and Cure of War was formed,
    comprised of the chief officers of the member organizations.
    Catt served as chairman until 1933, when she retired. The
    committee specialized in "marathon round tables" for the
    study of international conflicts.</p>
         <p>In addition to being a prolific writer of editorials,
    speeches and pamphlets on the women's movement, she
    collaborated with Nettie Rogers Shuler in writing Woman
    Suffrage and Politics (1923) and on her own wrote a book, Why
    Wars Must Cease (1935).</p>
         <p>Catt was given honorary doctorates from the University of
    Wyoming, Iowa State College, Smith College, and Moravian
    College for Women. In 1936, during her fiftieth anniversary
    celebration as a suffragist and pacifist, she was escorted to
    the White House by the presidents of several national women's
    organizations where President and Mrs. Roosevelt received
    her.</p>
         <p>In 1940, Catt organized the last event of her career, the
    Woman's Centennial Conference in New York, which celebrated
    the first one hundred years of the feminist movement in the
    United States. Carrie Chapman Catt died at home in New
    Rochelle, New York on March 9, 1947 at age 88. </p>

         <p>The Carrie Chapman Catt Papers date from 1880 to 1958 and
    consist of 1.75 linear feet of material relating primarily to
    her public life. Types of material include correspondence,
    speeches, pamphlets, photographs, reports, journal and
    newspaper articles, and political cartoons. The bulk of the
    papers surround Catt's work as president of both the National
    American Woman Suffrage Association and the International
    Woman Suffrage Alliance. There is also a significant amount
    of material pertaining to her peace activities, including the
    National Committee on the Cause and Cure of War. Major topics
    include federal- and state-level suffrage for women, the
    peaceful settlement of international disputes, and building
    an international network promoting women's equality. The
    collection is compelling as a record of the lengthy struggle
    for women's suffrage in the United States, and the powerful
    network of women's organizations that sprang out of that
    struggle. Catt published many short pamphlets describing her
    vision of feminism and women's suffrage that may be of
    particular interest to scholars. The papers also contain a
    rich collection of photographs, including many of the Women's
    Land Army, created in Great Britain during World War II to
    aid in the war effort. Most women lived at home and were
    transported each day to farms, where they hoed, weeded,
    thinned, and harvested crops of all kinds; many supervised
    youth platoons, especially teachers out of school for the
    summer. A few worked year round, especially on poultry and
    dairy farms, while others worked in canneries or were leaders
    for recruiting other women.</p>

               <p>Correspondence comprises roughly a quarter of the
          collection. Of particular interest to scholars may be
          Catt's involvement in political machinations surrounding
          the naming of a new police chief in Washington, D.C in
          1919. In addition, there is correspondence with state
          senators and representatives regarding support for a
          federal amendment granting women's suffrage; with
          President Woodrow Wilson; with colleagues within the
          National American Woman Suffrage Association; and
          regarding her peace activism. This series offers insight
          into the skilled political organization that was
          required, and achieved in large measure by Catt, in order
          for the women's suffrage movement to be successful.</p>
