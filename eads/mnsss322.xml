       <p>The American Association of University Women was founded in 1882 to unite alumnae of different institutions for "practical educational work."  Originally open to graduates of institutions accredited by the AAUW, it is now open to women graduates of regionally accredited U.S. colleges and universities or foreign institutions recognized by the International Federation of University Women.</p>

	<p>The Worcester, Massachusetts, branch of the AAUW was originally known as the Worcester College Club, founded in 1897.  The initial purpose of the club was the "fostering of a social spirit and securing fellowship and sympathy" among college graduates.  Upon becoming a branch of the AAUW in 1926, the club's members broadened their objectives, viz: "to concentrate and increase their influence in the community for the solution of social and civic problems."  The members formed cultural and practical study groups, presented scholarships and fellowships, sponsored lectures and exhibits, and performed charity work.  Among its leaders were Annie Russell Marble (1864-1936) and Lena Hill (Mrs. Charles G.).</p>
