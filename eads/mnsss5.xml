         <p>A graduate of Smith College (Class of 1899), Carolyn Adelia Boynton was, according to the Alumnae Biographical Register, 1935, a teacher in various states in the decade following graduation, then settled in New York City, where she lived at the Women's University Club on East 52nd Street and taught in Flushing.  In 1918 she went abroad to work for the Y.M.C.A. in Paris and Nice, returning in August 1919.  In subsequent years, during summers and semester leaves from the Flushing school, she seems to have travelled intermittently with a friend and/or met others along the way.  During her travels she collected dolls in native costumes and stamps for members of her family.  The 1936 correspondence and passport indicates she was going to retire in September 1937 and travel more extensively.</p>

      <scopecontent id="scope">
         
         <p>The Carolyn Adelia Boynton Papers consist of 19 letters and postcards written by Carolyn Boynton from Europe to her three sisters at 43 Beacon Street, Florence, Massachusetts, in the years 1918-19, 1926, and 1932;  her passport from 1936;  two photographs of her;  and an acknowledgement from Mount Holyoke College for material she sent them in 1936. </p>
         <p>The bulk of the letters and postcards are from the 1918-19 stay (she seems to have exchanged letters with her family on a weekly basis) and give lively and detailed descriptions of her work at the "Y"--in the canteen, library, and women's department--Paris during the war and on Armistice Day, and Nice and other towns she visited during the year and a half she was in France.  One letter was written in 1926 on a trip to France and Italy;  another in 1932, with an amusing description of an audience with the Pope of which she was part;  and then in 1936, with some vivid descriptions of Dubrovnik and other parts of Yugoslovia, including a visit by King Edward and the Duke of Kent and a plane ride she took to Sarajevo.</p>
