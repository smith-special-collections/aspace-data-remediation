<bioghist id="bioghist">
       
     <p>Susan Rosenberg was born in New York City in 1955, the daughter of Emanuel and Bella
Rosenberg, both of whom were progressive leftists.  Her father was a dentist who practiced in
Spanish Harlem and her mother was a theatrical producer; they regularly took their only child to
rallys in support of the civil rights movement and to demonstrations againt the war in Vietnam.
Rosenberg grew up on the Upper West Side and attended the very liberal Walden School from grade
school through high school by which time she was actively engaged in the anti-war movement.  After
high school, she initially attended Barnard College but transferred to the less elitist City
College, earning a degree in history.  She later went to Canada to become a doctor of Chinese
acupuncture and holistic medicine.
</p>
<p>Rosenberg worked first as a drug counselor in Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx and by the early 1980s
was working at the Harlem Institute of Acupuncture where the ancient Chinese practice was used to
treat drug addiction.  The Institute was founded by the Black Nationalist Mutulu Shakur who had
worked alongside Rosenberg at the Lincoln Hospital. Like Shakur, Rosenberg was much involved in
several radical political movements of the day.  She was active in the New Afrikan and Puerto Rican
independence movements and even more active in the May 19 (in honor of the birthdays of both
Malcolm X and Ho Chi Minh) Communist Organization, a coalition of sorts consisting of one faction
of the former Weather Underground and the Black Liberation Army.</p>

<p>In 1982, accused of assisting in the 1979 prison escape of Assata Shakur, Rosenberg went
underground.  She was also accused of driving the getaway car in the 1981 Brinks robbery that led
to the deaths of two police officers and an armored-car guard in upstate New York.  She was
captured in 1984, along with Timothy Blunt, while transferring guns and explosives from a car into
a Cherry Hills, New Jersey storage unit.  Found guilty of the illegal possesion of firearms and
explosives, Blunt and Rosenberg were each sentenced to fifty-eight years in jail.  Many at the time
felt the unusually long sentences were due to the revolutionary beliefs both expressed throughout
their trial. She served sixteen years before President Bill Clinton pardoned her on his last day in
office, January 20, 2001.</p>

<p>While in prison, Rosenberg was one of the first immates assigned in 1987 to the newly opened High
Security Unit for Women in Lexington, Kentucky.  Located underground, below the Federal
Correctional Institution there, this was an experimental program aimed at "political prisoners,"
subjecting them to sensory deprivation, isolation and frequent strip-searches.  After several
groups brought a law suit, a federal judge ordered the Unit closed in 1988. That same year,
Rosenberg was one of six people charged with the US Capitol bombing in 1983, along with several
other bombings in Washington, DC and New York City in which no one died but there was property
damage.  In what became known as the Resistance Conspiracy Case, many again felt the charges were
politically motivated.  Eventually, these charges against Rosenberg were dropped and she was then
transferred to a federal prison in Florida, later to California and served out the end of her
sentence in Danbury, Connecticut at the Federal Correctional Institution.</p>

<p>Also while in prison, Rosenberg earned a Master's degree from Antioch College, wrote a screenplay,
published poetry and essays, taught her fellow immates courses on Black history, worked as an AIDS
activist and as an advocate for more humane treatment of prisoners, in particular, female immates.
Throughout her time in prison, her mother and father (until his death in 1993) worked tirelessly to
gain their daughter's release, an effort that many others joined, including attorneys who
volunteered on the Rosenberg case.  Clinton's pardon in 2001 was not without controversy as some
Americans saw her not as a political prisoner but as a homegrown terrorist.  After complaints were
made in 2005, Rosenberg's adjunct contract was not renewed after two years of teaching at John Jay
College, a CUNY school.  A year earlier there was so much objection from alumni and parents of
current students to an invitation to serve as a visiting professor at Hamilton College that
Rosenberg herself declined the offer.  Her memoir, published in 2011, has engendered similar
negative responses from the right and praise from more liberal reviewers.  Entitled <title render="italic">An American
Radical: A Political Prisoner in my Own Country</title>, her autobiography focuses on her time in prison,
her struggles there and those of others to maintain a sense of self-worth and humanity in a system
designed, she contends, to do exactly the opposite.

     <p>The Susan Rosenberg papers are primarily associated with her sixteen years in prison (1984-
2001) and include correspondence, legal documents, photographs, poetry and essays written by
Rosenberg, course work, her Master's thesis, and syllabi for courses she taught while incarcerated.
There is a significant portion of the papers that reflect the constant effort by others to gain
Rosenberg's release.  There is also a large amount of printed matter relating to the American
prison system, the state of political prisoners in this country, and the specific concerns of women
in prison.  Of particular interest are the personal journals she kept during her time in prison.</p>
