	<p>The American Association of University Women was founded in l882 to unite alumnae of different institutions for "practical educational work."  Originally open to graduates of institutions accredited by the AAUW, it is now open to women graduates of regionally accredited U.S. colleges and universities or foreign institutions recognized by the International Federation of University Women.
</p>
	<p>In March l986 the State Division of the AAUW and local branches entered into a joint acquisition agreement with four separate archival repositories in Massachusetts.  </p>
	<p>The Connecticut Valley Branch of the AAUW was organized in February l925, at the instigation of Mary E. Woolley, President of Mount Holyoke College.  The first meeting took place in October l925.  The constitution states that the purpose of the branch is "to unite the college women of the vicinity and in the furtherance of the general work of the American Association of University Women."  The emphasis of the Connecticut Valley Branch continues to be the support of the AAUW Fellowships for graduate study.</p>
