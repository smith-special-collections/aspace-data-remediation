       <head>Historical Note</head>
     <p>The Women's Alliance for Theology, Ethics and Ritual (WATER) was co-founded  in Silver Spring, Maryland, in 1983 by Mary E. Hunt and Diann L.Neu in response to the need for theological, ethical, and liturgical development for and by women. It is a feminist educational center, working locally, nationally and internationally to bring about social justice through a feminist approach to theology and "promote the use of feminist values to make religious and social change."  Mary E. Hunt is a feminist theologian and ethicist who writes and lectures extensively on liberation issues. Diann L. Neu is a feminist liturgist and psychotherapist who develops rituals and provides counseling for individuals, couples, and groups.</p>
