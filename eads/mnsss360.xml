<bioghist id="bioghist">

<p>Jane Lakes Harman was born on June 28, 1945 in New York, New York, to Dr. and Mrs. Adolf and Lucille (née Geier) Lakes.  Her father, born in Poland, emigrated from Germany to the United States in the 1930s to escape Nazi Germany.  Her mother, whose family had emigrated from Russia, was born in the United States and was the first in her family to attend college.  The Lakes family moved to Los Angeles in 1949, where Dr. Lakes cultivated a successful medical career.  Harman attended public school in Los Angeles and graduated from University High School in 1962.</p>
<p>Fulfilling her mother's dream, Harman attended Smith College, graduating in 1966 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in government with honors.  An active resident of Tyler House during all four years at college, Harman was President of the Young Democrats Club during her senior year.  After finishing at Smith, Harman went on to attend Harvard University School of Law and graduated in 1969 with her Juris Doctorate (J.D.).  Later that year she married her first husband, Richard Frank.  They have two children, Brian, born in 1973, and Hilary, born in 1975.</p>
<p>The stimulus for Harman's career in government and politics came in 1960 when she was an usher at the 1960 Democratic Convention, the convention at which John F. Kennedy was nominated as the Democratic candidate for President.  Before launching this aspect of her career, she first established herself as a practicing lawyer in 1970 as an Associate at the law firm of Surrey &amp; Morse in Washington, D.C.  She left private practice in 1972 to become a Legislative Assistant to Senator John V. Tunney (D - California), assisting in his work on the Senate Public Works Committee.  Harman then took on the position of Chief Legislative Assistant and oversaw legal activities on three of the Senator's committees, Commerce, Judiciary and District of Columbia.  In 1973 she moved on to become Chief Counsel and Staff Director for the Committee on the Judiciary, Subcommittee on Representation of Citizen Interests.  She held this position until 1975 when she became the Chief Counsel and Staff Director for the Committee on the Judiciary, Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights.  </p>
<p>Leaving the Senate in 1977, she moved over to the White House as the Deputy Secretary to the Cabinet in the Carter administration, assisting Secretary to the Cabinet Jack Watson.  The year 1978 brought a much publicized change to Harman's life.  She chose to leave her job at the White House and spend more time with her children.  The headline in an article from The Atlanta Journal and Constitution (Atlanta, Georgia) on June 25, 1978 declared, "Woman Quitting Carter Inner-Circle To Be With Family."  Later that year she and her husband Richard Frank, then Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, divorced.</p>
 

<p>Harman resumed working outside of the home in 1979 by returning to government service as Special Counsel to the Department of Defense.  That same year she returned to private practice as a partner in the Washington, D.C. law firm of Manatt, Phelps, Rothenberg &amp; Tunney.  The next year in 1980 she married her second husband Sidney Harman, Chairman and CEO of Harman Industries.  They had their first child together, Daniel, in 1982, the same year that Harman rejoined the law firm of Surrey &amp; Morse.  Their second child, Justine, was born in 1984.  In 1986 Surrey &amp; Morse merged with Jones, Day, Reavis &amp; Pogue and Harman continued to work for them until winning her Congressional seat in 1992.</p>
<p>In addition to her professional career, Harman remained actively involved in politics and the Democratic Party throughout the 1980s.  In 1984 she served as Counsel for the Democratic Platform Committee.  She was Chair of the National Lawyers' Council, the legal arm of the Democratic National Committee, from its inception in 1986 until 1991 when she left to focus on her run for national office.  She co-chaired the 1987 Democratic Gala, an event to introduce the Democratic Presidential candidates and begin fundraising for the Presidential and Democratic Party Victory Fund.  Harman also participated in public policy activities, serving as Vice-Chair of the Center for National Policy from its reorganization in 1981 to the early 1990s.</p>  

<p>Harman ran for California's 36th District Congressional seat in 1992 and won, earning the distinction of being the first Smith College graduate to be elected to Congress.  Traditionally the 36th District had been a Republican stronghold.  Though Harman is a Democrat, her platform of progressive social policies and fiscal conservatism appealed to a majority of the voters.</p>
<p>In 1994 Harman was up for re-election and narrowly regained her seat.  The margin between Harman and her opponent Susan Brooks was 812 votes.  Harman was declared the winner and certified as such by the California Secretary of State in December 1994.  However, alleging voter fraud, Brooks contested the results in January 1995 to the House Oversight Committee, bypassing the contestation process in California election law.  The Committee began an investigation into the allegations and hearings were held in June but any resolution could have taken another year to come about.  Brooks thus decided to drop her challenge in July 1995.  As required by California code, the Secretary of State continued its investigation into instances of voter fraud well into 1996 but did not return any charges against the Harman campaign.  Harman won the next election in 1996, defeating Brooks by over 18,000 votes.</p>  

<p>In 1998 Harman decided to forego re-election for her Congressional seat and instead chose to run for Governor of California.  Despite valiant efforts and a clean campaign, she lost to Gray Davis in the Democratic Primary.  Harman's colleague, Janice Hahn, ran for her old Congressional seat but lost to Republican Steve Kuykendall.  During her time away from Congress, Harman taught public policy and international relations classes at the University of California - Los Angeles.  She also served on the Boards of Planned Parenthood of Los Angeles and the Venice Family Clinic.</p>
<p>Harman ran for the 36th District Congressional seat again in 2000 and was elected.  She was re-elected in 2002 and remained in office until February 2011, when she stepped down to take the position of Director, President and CEO of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. Just two months after she took the position, Sidney Harman died after a brief illness.</p>

<scopecontent id="scope">

<p>The Jane Harman Papers consist of 110 linear ft., dating from 1960 to 1998, and are primarily related to her political life and her legislative career.  Types of materials include correspondence, reports and research materials, journal and newspaper articles, press releases, photographs, and video- and audiotapes.  The papers are arranged in nine series.</p>
<p>This arrangement largely reflects the functions and activities of a Congressional office while incorporating facets of Harman's life before she became a member of Congress.  There are very few materials regarding her personal life outside of her professional career.</p>
<p>The bulk of the papers date from 1993 to 1998 and focus on Harman's first three terms as a U.S. Representative from the 36th district of California.  Major topics found in her political and legislative papers include national defense and the military (including women in the armed forces), the environment, space and technology, California-related issues, the Democratic National Party, healthcare, abortion, and domestic and international economic concerns.  Generally, there are more materials available from later in her political and legislative career than from the earlier years.</p>
<p>Correspondence comprises at least half of the collection.  Also well-represented are background and research materials that her staff used in legislative and political matters. </p> 

<p>Notable correspondents include:  Les Aspin, Samuel Berger, Justice Harry A. Blackmun, Sen. Robert Byrd, President Jimmy Carter, President Bill Clinton, Gloria Feldt and Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Vice President Al Gore, Judith L. Lichtman (Women's Legal Defense Fund), Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, Rep. Loretta Sanchez, Ruth J. Simmons (Smith College president, 1995-2001), and Gloria Steinem.</p>

 <p>This series provides a brief overview of Harman's life as a student at Smith College and her non-professional life.  It contains mostly correspondence, newspaper clippings, and award certificates.  Of special interest is a letter in the Smith College folder that Harman wrote to her parents, describing her daily life and activities at college.  "A Day in the Life of Jane Harman" is a whimsical composition of newspaper clippings and captions depicting a fictional day in Harman's Congressional work.  The piece was possibly created by some of her staff members.</p>

<scopecontent>
<p>This series relates to Jane Harman's non-Congressional professional life.  It is organized into five subseries:  White House, Publications, Correspondence, Organizations and conferences, and Office files.  The White House subseries pertains to Harman's time in the Carter administration as Deputy Secretary to the Cabinet.  It includes copies of correspondence with Secretary to the Cabinet Jack Watson, President Carter, and various White House officials and staff.  Publications contains articles about Harman or articles authored/co-authored by Harman during the 1970s.  Some articles of interest about Harman include those that report on her decision to leave the Carter administration to spend more time with her family and her effects on staff/cabinet relations at the White House.  Writings authored by Harman during her legislative career can be found throughout SERIES IV. LEGISLATIVE FILES and SERIES VI. MEDIA ACTIVITIES.</p>
	
<p>Ranging from 1974 to 1992, the Correspondence subseries includes intra-office and outside correspondence from Jones, Day, Reavis and Pogue; papers pertaining to family business and the Harman Family Foundation; and correspondence regarding political contributions and thank yous.  The political contributions and thank yous correspondence is to Jane and Sidney Harman or just Jane Harman regarding contributions (monetary and otherwise) to various political campaigns, including letters from Patrick Leahy, Tom Daschle, Harriett Woods, Barbara Boxer, Robert C. Byrd and various other Democratic candidates and organizations. </p>
<p>The next subseries, Organizations and conferences, contains materials on organizations with which Harman was involved or conferences that she attended.  The items from the Women's Legal Defense Fund (WLDF) from 1971 detail her involvement with litigation on behalf of the WLDF including legal documents and related correspondence.  Of particular interest is a case in which the WLDF wrote an amicus brief on behalf of a woman who was declared "unfit" in a divorce case because she worked outside the home.  Later items mainly concern Harman's monetary contributions to the organization.</p>
<p>Women and the Constitution was a 1988 seminar held at the Carter Center.  Harman chaired a panel on "The Contemporary Supreme Court and Women."  The materials consist mainly of correspondence from 1987 to 1988 about the conference, including a letter from Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and conference materials.  Conference participants included Rosalynn Carter, Lady Bird Johnson, Bella Abzug, Geraldine Ferraro and Coretta Scott King.</p>
<p>The National Democratic Institute for International Affairs (NDIIA) is associated with the U.S. Democratic Party.  In 1988 the NDIIA assembled a group to consult on the Chilean elections, and this was the nature of Harman's involvement.  The contents include 1988 reports, correspondence and other materials concerning the Chilean elections and international election observing.</p>

<p>The files are arranged chronologically in Harman's original filing order.  The Los Angeles folder contains correspondence from Harman's time at the Jones, Day, Reavis and Pogue office in Los Angeles.</p>
</arrangement>
<accessrestrict>
<p>Office files consist of correspondence from Harman's time at Jones, Day, Reavis and Pogue, from 1987 to 1992.  These files are closed until January 1, 2013.  Some of the correspondence is specific to office activities but much is of a more general professional or political nature and sometimes relates to Harman International/Harman Industries.</p>

It is divided into four subseries: General correspondence, Speeches, Democratic National Party, and Campaigns.  General correspondence includes incoming and outgoing correspondence arranged chronologically by year (1995-98) and correspondence organized by type and listed in chronological order (1992-98).  The correspondence arranged by year is to and from other members of Congress, agency officials, organizations, corporations and local officials and leaders.  It covers a range of topics but is often related to political and legislative matters or projects with which Harman was involved or in which the correspondent requested her participation.</p>  
	
<p>The correspondence organized by type uses the original designations of Harman and her staff and includes thank you letters, correspondence with government agencies, and recommendations for government appointments.  The relationship between this correspondence and the chronological correspondence is fluid in terms of subject matter.  Additional correspondence may also be found in SERIES IV. LEGISLATIVE FILES in various topical files.</p>
<p>The Speeches subseries dates from 1973 to 1980 and includes addresses given to law-related groups, various Bar associations and private organizations.  They are arranged chronologically.  Speeches that Harman gave during her political campaigns can be found later in this series according to the particular race, and Congressional speeches and addresses can be found throughout SERIES IV. LEGISLATIVE FILES.</p>
<p>Harman has been involved with various aspects of the Democratic National Party since her college years and the Democratic National Party subseries contains files beginning in 1980.  In 1984 Harman served as counsel to the Democratic Platform Committee.  The correspondence folders contain lists of contents in the front of the folder and the corresponding numbered tabs remain in the folder.</p>
<p>The Democratic Policy Committee published the "Weekender" as a newsletter to keep Democratic House members informed of Congressional happenings.  The publication was issued irregularly but it is arranged in chronological order.</p>
<p>The Campaigns subseries contains materials on all of Harman's House campaigns from 1992 to 1996 and her gubernatorial campaign in 1998.  The files are arranged according to the particular campaign and are more abundant for her later races.  They contain newspaper clippings, publicity materials, briefing books, issue files, and working files.  Audiovisual materials relating to Harman's political campaigns, including interviews and campaign ads, can be found in SERIES IX. AUDIOVISUAL MATERIALS. </p> 

<p>Friends of Jane Harman is Harman's campaign fundraising group.  The files for this group are largely correspondence with campaign supporters, political colleagues, and staff of Friends of Jane Harman.</p>
<p>Harman won the 1994 race for Representative of the 36th District.  However, the election results were very close and Harman's opponent Susan Brooks called for an investigation into voter fraud.  Investigations of those allegations continued to some extent into 1996, but no charges were found to be of substance.  This section contains correspondence, legal documents, press materials and other information from this period.</p>
<p>There is one folder containing materials on Janice Hahn's 1998 House race for the 36th District.  </p>
<p>The reference materials included in this subseries were used by Harman and her staff and relate to the various aspects of conducting a campaign.  They are arranged by author and then chronologically within author.</p>

<scopecontent>
<p>This series is the largest in the collection, representing the files of Harman's office from the 103rd Congress through the 105th Congress (1993-98).  It is arranged in 11 subseries: Voting and attendance records, Bills sponsored/cosponsored, Co-signed letters, House National Security Committee, Legislative staff files, Project files, Subject/issue files, Whip schedules and reports, Briefing books, Legislative Weekly Updates, and Research materials.</p>
<p>The Voting and attendance records subseries contains records of votes and attendance for Jane Harman for the specified term.  They are arranged chronologically by session.</p>
<p>Bills sponsored/cosponsored also provide a record of Harman's legislative activities in addition to her voting and attendance records.  These are copies of most of the bills, joint resolutions, concurrent resolutions, and simple resolutions that Harman either sponsored or cosponsored from the 103rd to 105th Congresses (1993-98).  They are arranged chronologically by Congress.  Legislative profiles from the 104th and 105th Congresses provide an overview of the status of bills Harman sponsored.</p>
<p>In addition to writing and sponsoring bills, Harman also contributed to official legislative letters that were sent to colleagues, the White House, or other government agencies.  Co-signed letters represents the letters Harman co-signed from the 105th Congress (1997-98).  They are arranged alphabetically by the topic assigned by Harman's office staff.  The topics range greatly from AIDS drug assistance program funding to Land and Water Conservation Fund funding to transit projects in California.</p>
<p>As part of her legislative responsibilities, Harman served on a number of committees during her tenure.  The House National Security Committee subseries contains copies of files from this committee for the 104th and 105th Congresses.   These files are closed for 30 years until January 1, 2029 according to Rule XI and Rule XXXVI of the Rules of the House of Representatives of the 105th Congress.  The committee files are arranged chronologically by Congress and then alphabetically by topic within a Congress.  Although there are no other file groups specifically identified as committee files for the other committees on which Harman served, committee-related materials can be found in the Legislative staff files, especially in Ron Stone's files, and in Subject/issue files, mainly in Defense and Women in the armed forces.  See the <ref target="odd-app">Appendix</ref> for a listing of Harman's committee assignments for the 103rd-105th Congresses.</p>
<p>Legislative staff files, dating from 1993 to 1998 with the bulk from 1997 to 1998, represent the work of four Legislative Assistants and the Legislative Director of Harman's legislative staff: Maria Alongi (1997-98?), Bryan Banks (1998), David Flanders (1995-98), Danny Geffen (1993-96?), and Ron Stone (1993-96?).  David Flanders was the Legislative Director from 1995 to 1998 and then Chief of Staff from June 1998 to December 1998.  The work of additional members of the legislative staff (John Conger, George Raach, Mary Vesely, and Mike Hammon) can be found throughout SERIES IV. LEGISLATIVE FILES in various subject files.  The first folder in this subseries, Legislative assignments, delineates the assignment of legislative topics to various staff members for 1996-98.  The staff files are arranged alphabetically by the staff member's last name.  Maria Alongi also worked on topics with, or took over responsibilities from, Danny Geffen and Ron Stone and those files are listed under Geffen/Alongi or Stone/Alongi.</p>  

<p>Project files consist of legislative and non-legislative projects in which Harman and her staff were interested or with which they were involved.  They date from 1995 to 1998 and are arranged alphabetically by topic.</p>
<p>Subject/issues files are divided into three areas: Defense, Women in the armed forces, and General.  Public hearings and published reports remain open.  The files are arranged alphabetically by topic and range from 1993 to 1998.  Topics represented in the Defense files are the B-2 bomber, Big Think Forums, defense conversion/dual-use technology, export policy, defense firms, Los Angeles Air Force Base and base realignment/closure, missile defense, military programs, and weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p>The Women in the armed forces files are arranged alphabetically by topic and date from 1993 to 1998.  Many files in this group relate to integrated training and sexual harassment in the armed forces.</p>
<p>The General subject/issues files are arranged by Congress and then alphabetically by subject.  General - 105th is the largest of the groups and is preceded by Major legislative initiatives and issues - 105th.  Files pertaining to specific bills are usually listed by number (e.g., HR 988 - Attorney Accountability Act).  Legislative summary files and files descriptive of a session's activities are usually listed first.</p>
<p>Whip schedules and reports are correspondence and newsletters from the Democratic Whip.  They date from the 104th Congress (1995-96) and 1st session of the 105th Congress (1997).  The Whips are responsible for rallying their respective parties and coordinating party activities regarding legislation.  The Democratic Whip for the 104th and 105th Congresses was David E. Bonior (D-Michigan).</p>
<p>Briefing books are prepared by Harman's staff or other organizations to provide a concise source of information about a particular topic.  They are organized by year, then alphabetically by topic.  Briefing books relating to Harman's political campaigns can be found in SERIES III. POLITICAL ACTIVITIES.</p>
<p>Legislative Weekly Updates are memos to Harman from her legislative staff in Washington, D.C. These serve to update her on current projects and legislation, propose future actions, and provide recommendations on whether to attend various events, sessions, or hearings.  These Updates are from 1998; it is not known whether the Updates were produced in earlier years.  For updates from her district staff in California, see SERIES VII. OFFICE ADMINISTRATION.</p>
<p>Research materials are mostly government publications or publications from private organizations that are not widely available elsewhere.  These are arranged by year, then alphabetically by author/title.</p>
</scopecontent>
<accessrestrict>
<p>Select portions of Alongi's files and Stone's files are closed until January 1, 2029, as noted in the folder list.</p>
<p>The Defense files are closed until January 1, 2029, because they contain materials relating to the House National Security Committee.</p>
<p>The Women in the armed forces files are similarly closed until January 1, 2029.</p>

<scopecontent>
<p>This series shows the interaction between Harman and her constituents.  It is arranged in six subseries: Constituent mail, District concerns, District visits, Constituent requests, Response form letters, and Response correspondence.</p>
<p>Constituent mail is incoming correspondence from constituents to Harman's offices from 1993 to 1998.  It is arranged chronologically by Congress and session beginning with the 103rd Congress, 1st session (1993) and ending with the 105th Congress, 2nd session (1998).  Within a Congressional session, the folders are arranged alphabetically by topic.  The topic heading "Random" is the staff's equivalent of miscellaneous letters.</p>
<p>This subseries was sampled to reduce bulk and represents 20-25% of the original material.  The remainder is a representative sample of the original content, given that the sampling method reduced every topic by the same percentage and the original topics remain.</p>  

<p>The District concerns subseries contains materials relating to important issues in Harman's Congressional district.  The topics are arranged alphabetically, beginning with Airport issues and ending with Women.  Two additional topics, North end of district issues and South end of district issues, follow Women and contain materials specific to certain cities and towns in Harman's district.  These are arranged alphabetically by town. Places included in the North end are Lawndale, Marina del Rey, Venice, and Westchester.  Places included in the south end are Avalon, El Segundo, Gardena Valley, Hermosa Beach, Lomita, Manhattan Beach, Palos Verdes, Redondo Beach, and Torrance.</p> 

<p>The District visits subseries contains materials on Harman's visits to her district from 1994 to 1998.  The visits are organized chronologically.  Visits with a special purpose or for a specific event as delineated by her staff are noted.</p>
<p>In addition to voicing their views on current or upcoming legislation in constituent mail, constituents also asked Harman's office for assistance on more specific matters relating to their communities.  Constituent requests contains those requests from 1994 to 1997.  Some letters were forwarded to other agencies that could be of more help.</p>  

<p>Due to the volume of correspondence received by a Congressional office, it is difficult for Congresspersons and their staffs to write individual responses.  Response form letters contains the form letters that Harman and her staff used to respond to much of the regular constituent correspondence they received.  There are various form letters from 1993 to 1998.</p>
<p>Response correspondence consists of responses to items that Harman's office sent out from 1993 to 1996.  Occasionally Harman's office wrote personalized replies to incoming constituent mail using pre-written prints.  The original constituent letter often accompanies these.</p>

<scopecontent>
<p>This series represents the overall operations of Harman's offices.  The legislative office staff is just one component of the overall staff it takes to successfully operate Harman's district and Washington offices.  There are four subseries: Chief of Staff files, Office files, District Office Updates, and Reference materials.</p> 

<p>The Chief of Staff is in charge of the entire staff that works for the Congressperson.  From 1993 to 1998, at least four different people held this position in Harman's office and the Chief of Staff files contain materials the chiefs of staff retained and kept separate from other office files.  Bill Black has one file that dates from 1993.  It is not apparent from the collection whether he was Chief of Staff for the entire 103rd Congress.  Mark Kadesh was Chief of Staff from 1995 to 1997.  The notebooks contain Kadesh's notes from his day-to-day work and are not dated in any definitive manner.  Mike Monasmith was the Chief of Staff from 1997 to 1998.  His files are organized alphabetically by topic.  David Flanders was the Chief of Staff for the last part of 1998.  It does not appear that he kept any specific office files, although his notebooks in SERIES IV. LEGISLATIVE FILES may contain office related content.</p>
<p>Office files are the general files that the staff used in their daily operations.  The "Bible" is the office handbook from the 103rd Congress, although it is not complete.  The guestbook lists those visitors who signed in when visiting Harman's district office.  The scheduling memos provide insight into how Harman and her staff organized her schedule and decided which events and meetings were worth attending.  They are organized chronologically from 1994 through 1998.  The General files are arranged by Congress and then alphabetically by topic.  Most of those files are from the 105th Congress (1997-98).</p>
<p>District Office Updates are memos sent to the Washington office to update Harman and the Washington staff on the activities of her district office.  They include staff news and assignments, progress reports on constituent issues and notices of important events and activities.  They are arranged chronologically.</p>
<p>Reference materials are the publications and reports that Harman and her staff used to inform themselves on how to operate a Congressional office and the rules of being a Congressperson.  They are organized by Congress.</p>
