<p>Thomas Corwin Mendenhall was the sixth president of Smith College, and the last male president to take office. He accepted the position in 1958, and began work in the fall of 1959. He remained at the college for 16 years, retiring in the spring of 1975. Over the years he became a respected and beloved member of the Smith community, seeing the institution through one of the most divisive periods in American history with skill, sensitivity, and a precocious sense of humor.
</p>
<p>Mendenhall arrived at Smith with more than 20 years of experience as an educator and administrator.  After receiving degrees from Yale (Class of 1932), and Oxford's Balliol College (B.A. 1935, B.Litt. 1936), he returned to Yale as a professor of history in 1937. Six years later he began taking on administrative duties, first as assistant to the provost (1943-1950), then as the master of Berkeley College (1950-1959). He also had experience with Smith itself by way of his mother, Dorothy Reed Mendenhall, Smith Class of 1895.
</p>
<p>Mendenhall was president during a challenging and eventful period for academic administrators across the country. He successfully guided the college through both national and local upheaval, weathering the social and political disputes that have become the hallmark of the 1960s and early 1970s. As the country battled over civil rights, the wars in Southeast Asia, and class iniquity, Smith became one of the thousands of colleges and universities across the country compelled to join the fray both nationally and locally. The legacies of  student and faculty activism at Smith can be seen in the curriculum, social regulations, and even administrative structure and procedures. Afro-American Studies (via the Five Colleges), the Bridge Program, and the student exchange program with  historically Black colleges all began during these years as a result of local and national struggles for civil rights and class equality. Recruitment programs attempted to diversify the population of students, as well as that of faculty and staff. The debate over coeducation also reached a pinnacle during the Mendenhall years, and the women's movement began to impact the college's curriculum and administrative structure. The Mendenhall Files illustrate the evolution of these issues via the records of individual Smith offices, departments and committees, but also through correspondence with alumnae, students and parents who needed not only to be informed, but in some cases placated in their anger and disappointment.
</p>
<p>Changes in the administration and population were accompanied by renovation and addition to the physical layout of the college. Mendenhall oversaw the construction of three new centers and the renovation of several existing buildings. The Clark Science Center, the Fine Arts Center, and the Mendenhall Center for the Performing Arts were all constructed between 1959 and 1975. There was also a significant addition to Neilson Library.
</p>
<p>As president of one of the premier women's colleges in the country, Mendenhall was also required to participate in intercollegiate associations such as the Seven Sisters, the Pioneer Valley's Five Colleges, Inc., and the primarily ivy league 12-College Exchange. He was also the Smith representative and point person for many educational organizations and related businesses. His daily schedule was crowded not only with campus activities and responsibilities, but also with speaking engagements and meetings at a variety of  locales across the country. The extent of his responsibilities is most apparent in five records series in the collection: Colleges &amp; Universities, Events, Engagements, Intercollegiate Associations, and Non-Smith Organizations. His philosophies and opinions on a variety of issues and events are documented throughout the collection, but are detailed most specifically in the Speeches series.
</p>
<p>Throughout his tenure, Mendenhall played key roles in traditional college events, was cheered for his formal and informal talks, and came to be known by successive classes of students and alumnae as "Uncle Tom." He could be seen regularly rowing on Paradise Pond, made frequent appearances at dinners and teas in the student residences, and took an active role in the daily life of the college. He also remained an active educator, teaching in the history department throughout his presidency. When he died On July 18, 1998, at the age of 88, he was mourned by many from the Smith community. The following October, there was a memorial service in the Hills Chapel where friends and spoke about his legacies as an administrator, an educator, and a charismatic character in the history of Smith College.

<acqinfo id="admin-acqinfo">
<p>The majority of the Mendenhall Files were transferred to the College Archives from the Office of the President in a number of accessions dating from the time of his tenure until the present. Some material, however, came from Mendenhall himself after his retirement in 1975, and then from his wife, Cornelia Mendenhall, after his death in 1998. Additional biographical materials, such as news clippings, press releases, and photographs, have been added by the College Archives staff.

 are programs administered by the departments. For
 example, files from the Smith College Day Schools are
 included as a sub-series of the Department of Education.
 However, undergraduate and graduate academic programs
 administered either jointly by two or more departments,
 or by a separate and autonomous college office are filed
 either with Academic Programs or Administrative Offices.

<p>The files in the Administrative Issues series document
 activity in the President's Office which is either of a
 general nature, requiring the attention of only the
 president and his closest assistants, or requiring the
 participation of a number of administrative bodies at
 once. Included in this series are records relating to a
 number of general issues, such as administrative
 structure, the curriculum, the college calendar, disaster
 preparedness, bomb threats, and energy conservation. The
 issues generally requiring the attention of the president
 and his assistants include the president's annual
 reports, town and gown relations, secondary education,
 and emeritus Smith presidents and their families. Issues
 that involve a number of administrative bodies include
 computer and audiovisual equipment and facilities, and
 the confidentiality of student records. There is also a
 collection of miscellaneous correspondence handled by the
 President's Office.</p>

<p>This series includes material on a number of issues
 related to the alumnae in general as well as the Alumnae
 Association and its activities. There is a series of
 chronological files containing letters to President
 Mendenhall from individual alumna. Many are routine and
 pro forma letters of thank you for attending certain
 functions, or congratulations on his successes as an
 administrator. However, there are also letters scattered
 throughout addressing specific issues of both local and
 national concern. Several letters from roughly 1959-1961
 address Mendenhall's inauguration, the National Defense
 Education Act and its loyalty oath, and continuing
 education for adults. Many letters from 1964-1966 discuss
 early marriage, coeducation, minority recruitment, and
 campus unrest. From approximately 1969-1972 there are
 many letters addressing the Vietnam War and student
 protest. There are also letters about civil rights,
 coeducation, parietal regulations, equal opportunity for
 female academics, pass/fail grading, and the burgeoning
 women's liberation movement. There is additional
 information about continuing education for alumnae in the
 Graduate Work series. There is also a collection of
 alumnae correspondence relating to parietal regulations
 in the Students series.</p>

<scopecontent id="desc-ser9">
<p>This series includes correspondence, reports and
 working papers of the standing and ad-hoc committees and
 boards of the college. The most central and far-reaching
 decision-making bodies are the Board of Trustees, the
 Board of Counselors, and the Committee on Planning and
 Resources (previously the College Planning Committee and
 the Faculty Planning Committee). However, college policy
 and the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act require
 the restriction of the records of both the Board of
 Trustees and the Board of Counselors. The records of the
 Committee on Planning and Resources contain the bulk of
 information on the debate over coeducation, as well as
 many budgetary and structural issues. More information
 about coeducation may be found in the folowing
 series:</p>

<p>This series of records works in concert with the
 Speeches and Events series to provide a detailed
 description of the activities and responsibilities of the
 President of Smith College. Included are a nearly
 complete set of Mendenhall's appointment calendars
 (missing only 1968-1969 and 1973-1974), and another set
 of calendars from the Secretary to the President,
 Florence McDonald. There is also a large collection of
 correspondence documenting the planning and organization
 of Mendenhall's schedule of outside speaking engagements
 and official functions. The speaking engagements include
 talks at Smith Clubs, local fraternal and civic
 organizations, as well as a variety of regional and
 national organizations. Events which occurred on campus
 are not documented in this series; that information can
 be found in the Events series and in the records of
 specific Smith departments, offices, and committees. The
 Speeches series includes any notes or transcripts of the
 speeches given both on campus and off. The records in the
 Engagements series are organized chronologically by the
 date of the event.</p>

<p>Along with the Speeches and Engagements series, the
 records in this series document the activities and
 responsibilities of the President of Smith College. The
 events in this series (as opposed to the Engagements
 series) include significant campus traditional gatherings
 and celebrations as well as one-time happenings. Routine
 events include assemblies, commencement, Rally Day, and
 the awarding of Smith College Medals and honorary
 degrees. Other events include Mendenhall's inauguration,
 and the college's centennial celebrations in 1974-1975.
 The centennial records also include research the
 president did on his own as well as what a paid assistant
 completed in part for the 1974 Katharine Asher Engel
 Lecture and its publication as, Chance and Change in
 Smith College's First Century (Northampton: Smith
 College, 1976). Documentation of plans to hold an event
 at Smith in honor of International Women's Year in 1975
 are also included in this series, even though the event
 was eventually canceled.</p>

<scopecontent>
<p>The Graduate Work series includes correspondence, news
 clippings, and reports regarding the evolution and
 operation of several graduate studies programs at the
 college. There are records documenting general aspects of
 graduate education, as well as specific programs of
 study, such as the American Studies Diploma Program,
 teacher training at the Clarke School for the Deaf, the
 Smith-Northampton Summer School, the Master of Arts in
 Teaching program; the Department of Theater and Speech's
 Master of Fine Arts program; and the School of Social
 Work. There are also records documenting the evolution of
 continuing education programs for alumnae which led to a
 Smith graduate degree. Information about other
 educational programs for alumnae which did not lead to a
 degree can be found in the Alumnae series.</p>

<unittitle>Series XIV. INTERCOLLEGIATE
 ASSOCIATIONS</unittitle>
<physdesc>
<extent>6 document boxes / 2.5 linear feet</extent>
</physdesc>
</did>
<scopecontent>
<p>There are four intercollegiate associations included
 in this series: Five Colleges, Inc., the Seven Sisters,
 the Twelve-College Exchange, and the College Research
 Center.</p>
<p>Five Colleges: The Five Colleges material includes
 correspondence, reports and news clippings tracing the
 evolution of cooperative relations between Smith College,
 Mount Holyoke College, Hampshire College, Amherst
 College, and the University of Massachusetts at
 Amherst.</p>
<p>Seven Sisters: The records of the Seven Sisters
 include correspondence, reports and news clippings
 documenting relations between seven of the most important
 women's colleges in the Eastern United States: Barnard,
 Bryn Mawr, Mount Holyoke, Radcliffe, Smith, Vassar, and
 Wellesley.</p>
<p>Twelve-College Exchange: The Twelve-College Exchange
 files include records of the student exchange program
 begun in 1969 which eventually included the following
 institutions: Smith, Amherst, Bowdoin, Connecticut,
 Dartmouth, Mount Holyoke, Trinity, Vassar, Wellesley
 ,Wesleyan, Wheaton, and Williams. The program had a
 publicly stated purpose of expanding the collegiate
 experience for the students, but privately was initiated
 as an experiment in coeducation for several traditionally
 single-sex institutions.</p>
<p>College Research Center: The College Research Center
 began in 1962 as a cooperative research program, focusing
 specifically on administrative and educational issues at
 women's colleges. The initiating institutions were Mount
 Holyoke, Vassar, and Wheaton. Smith College joined the
 center in its third year, but remained only until 1967.
 The records in this series include reports and
 correspondence generated by the center and its
 participating institutions. Other members of the center
 during Smith's involvement include: Hollins, Sweet Briar,
 Briarcliff, Connecticut, Trinity, and Randolph-Macon
 Woman's Colleges. Brown University was not a member of
 the center but served as a consultant and a home for the
 center in the earliest stages.</p>

<p>The material in this series documents the variety of
 national, regional and local organizations which had an
 impact on and a relationship with the college. Included
 are reports, news clippings and correspondence with a
 number of academic, civic, corporate and nonprofit
 organizations. President Mendenhall was particularly
 active with the College Entrance Examination Board, the
 Association of American Colleges, and the Association of
 Independent Schools and Universities of Massachusetts. In
 1962 he helped to found Catalyst, a national organization
 devoted to supporting women returning to the workforce.
 The files in this series are organized alphabetically by
 organization, with two files of miscellaneous
 organizations at the end, also organized
 alphabetically.</p>

<p>The duties of the President included many public
 speaking engagements, not only at Smith College events
 but at local and national gatherings as well. The records
 in this series include notes and some full texts for many
 of these speeches. There is also a collection of note
 cards and clippings of quotes Mendenhall gathered on
 various topics for use in both his writings and speaking
 engagements. The records in this series are filed
 chronologically by event and are labeled with one or all
 of the following: title, location, and event. More
 detailed information about the events themselves can be
 found in the Events and Engagements series, and in some
 cases in the records of sponsoring Smith Administrative
 Offices, Academic Departments or Committees &amp; Boards,
 as well as Non-Smith Organizations.</p>

<p>The records in this series document the relationship
 of the Smith student body with the faculty and
 administration of the college. The bulk of the series
 relates to the student unrest which in so many ways
 defined the era of Mendenhall's presidency. There are
 also records of more traditional student organizations
 and activities, such as student government, publications
 and extracurriculars. Information about students can also
 be found in the records of Committees &amp; Boards with
 student representation, as well as in the records of
 specific student residences in the Buildings &amp;
 Grounds series.</p>
