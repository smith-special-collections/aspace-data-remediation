<p>Mary Maples Dunn was Smith's president from 1985 to 1995, an economically troubled period for the college. But the imbalanced budget was just one of the challenging issues she faced during her tenure. Campus diversity, internal communication flow, and socially responsible investment were also significant issues during her presidency.  However, Dunn maintained a cheerful image and a sense of humor throughout, and persevered through the trials of her difficult position.</p>
<p>Dunn took office in 1985 after seven years as an administrator at another of the famed Seven Sister colleges, Bryn Mawr. In fact until that point nearly the entirety of Dunn's academic career was spent at Bryn Mawr. After she received her undergraduate degree from William &amp; Mary in 1954, she went on to Bryn Mawr to do her graduate work in colonial U.S. history. She began teaching at the college while she was completing her Ph.D. then moved through the academic and administrative hierarchy until she became Dean of the Undergraduate College in 1978 then Academic Deputy to the President in 1981.</p>
<p>When she arrived at Smith the first order of business was to work on her fundraising skills.  Development became a significant part of the duties of the President during Jill Ker Conway's tenure. Dunn immediately set to work on enlarging the college's endowment and locating funding for several new initiatives. The battle to balance the college's books included two capital campaigns, an increase in tuition, and a number of structural changes. Alterations in employee benefit packages and offers of early retirement had a significant impact on the college staff and caused considerable distress in the community. But while scaling back in some quarters of the campus, Dunn also had to fund necessary progress. Physical changes included the construction of Bass Science Center and the Young Science Library, and a number of renovations to residence houses. She also began the process of getting the college on the "Information Highway." The internet was first introduced to campus during her tenure along with e-mail and voice mail.</p>
<p>As Dunn was preparing to leave the college she reflected, "It's true that acquiring budgetary accountability is among my most important achievements, but I hope I'll be remembered as a president who helped open the college up to a more diverse population." Some of Dunn's most well-known challenges were related to diversity. South African divestment was a source of much conflict on campus when she first arrived, and a few years later inadequate office space for the multicultural organizations on campus reached a fever pitch. Dunn also had to deal with continuing publicity and institutional attitudes about Smith students' sexuality. Throughout her tenure Dunn was repeatedly forced to address media coverage of Smith, Northampton and the "L-Word." Her administration created programs, wrote position papers, and adjusted college policies and structure in order to deal with the questions of race and sexuality. The most extensive program, the 1988 Smith Design for Institutional Diversity, dealt primarily with race, but other endeavors handled questions related to sexuality, physical disabilities, and derogatory language.</p>
<p>When Dunn left Smith 1995, she went on to become director of the Schlesinger Library on the History of Women, then interim president of Radcliffe College and acting dean of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. Dunn left the Radcliffe Institute to become Co-Executive Officer, with her husband Richard, of the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. They retired from that position in July 2007.</p>

</did>
<arrangement>
<p>The files in this series are arranged alphabetically by the most recent name of the department.</p>
</arrangement>
<scopecontent>
<p>Included are newspaper clippings, correspondence, and reports from the undergraduate departments of the college. Also included are programs administered by the departments. For example, files from the Smith College Campus School are included as a sub-series of the Department of Education. However, undergraduate and graduate academic programs administered either jointly by two or more departments, or by a separate and autonomous college office, are filed either with Academic Programs or Administrative Offices. Graduate Programs are filed in the Graduate Work series. Information about Five College joint academic programs in several areas of study can be found in the Intercollegiate Associations series.

<unittitle>SERIES IV. ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUES</unittitle>
<physdesc>
<extent>(11 document boxes / 4.6 linear feet)</extent>
</physdesc>
</did>
<scopecontent>
<p>This series documents activity in the President's Office which is either of a general nature, requiring the attention of only the president and her closest assistants, or requiring the participation of a number of administrative bodies at once. Included in this series are records relating to a number of general issues, such as Legislators and Legislation, Lesbianism, Race, and Women's Education. At the end of the series there is a collection of miscellaneous correspondence handled by the President's Office, filed in chronological order. Several issues, such as lesbianism, race and South Africa divestment, pervaded many areas of campus activity. Because material on these topics can be found under a variety of headings, a Subject Guide has been provided on pages 9-11 of this finding aid to assist the researcher.

<accessrestrict>
<p>Note: Boxes 2-5 of the Alumnae series is restricted until June 2005, because of its alphabetical rather than chronological arrangement.</p>
</accessrestrict>
<scopecontent>
<p>This series includes material on a number of issues related to the alumnae, as well as the Alumnae Association and its activities. The bulk of the files contain information about the Alumnae Association, class reunions, Smith Clubs, and specific individuals. The section related to individuals is in alphabetical order, and contains correspondence to, from and about alumnae. Many are routine and pro forma letters of thank you for attending certain functions, or congratulations on administrative successes. However, there are also letters scattered throughout addressing specific issues pertinent to the period. Information about alumnae involvement with Admissions can be found in the records of Alumnae/Admissions Task Force in the Committees and Boards series, and in the records of the Admissions Office's Candidates Committees in the Administrative Offices series.

<unittitle>SERIES IX. COMMITTEES AND BOARDS</unittitle>
<physdesc>
<extent>(9 document boxes / 3.8 linear feet)</extent>
</physdesc>
</did>
<scopecontent>
<p>This series includes correspondence, reports and working papers of the standing and ad-hoc committees and boards of the college. The most central and far-reaching decision-making bodies are the Board of Trustees, the Board of Counselors, and the Committee on Planning and Resources (previously the College Planning Committee and the Faculty Planning Committee). However, college policy and the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act require the restriction of the records of both the Board of Trustees and the Board of Counselors. Other significant committees in this series include several faculty committees, the Committee on Social Responsibility and the Committee on Student Affairs. Also included in this series are three free-standing administrative groups: Administrative Department Heads, Senior Administrative Group, and Senior Staff. The files of the Senior Staff are the most extensive of these three groups. The Senior Staff (also know as the President's Staff) included key administrative figures, such as the Treasurer, the Directors of Development and Public Relations, Assistants to the President, and Deans and Associate Deans. Minutes and major reports from most committees are available in the Dean of the Faculty Records of the Smith College Archives.

There are also a set of calendars, daily schedules, travel schedules, and a sample of engagements the president had to refuse.
