<bioghist id="bioghist">
       
    <p> Edith Rubin Konecky was born in Brooklyn, New York, the daughter of Harry and Elizabeth Smith
Rubin.  Her father, the quintessential self-made man, had escaped the pogroms in Eastern Europe,
immigrating to America where he would become a prosperous dress manufacturer.  This distant, driven
character would feature prominently in two of Konecky's most acclaimed novels, <title render="italic">Allegra Maud
Goldman</title> (1976) and <title render="italic">A Place at the Table</title> (1989). Her writing "career," began in high school when
she won her first writing prize. She then went on to New York University for two years, leaving
before graduation.   In 1944, Edith Rubin married Murray L. Konecky and together they would have
two children, Michael and Joshua.</p>
<p>
  Even as she entered into her life as a suburban mother in the
1950s, Edith Konecky did not stop writing, using her daily experiences as fodder for her short
stories.  She returned to school, graduating from Columbia University in 1961.  Only a year later
she won a Yaddo fellowship, giving her the space both mentally and physically, to focus on her
writing.  During the 1960s and into the 1970s, Konecky published several short stories and then in
1976, her widely-aclaimed first novel, <title render="italic">Allegra Maud Goldman</title>.  Konecky and her husband divorced in
1963 and by the time <title render="italic">Allegra </title>appeared, Konecky came out as a lesbian.  Her coming out process
partially infused her next well-received novel, <title render="italic">A Place at the Table</title> (1989).  She has continued
to publish into the 21st century and as the Jewish Women's Archive notes, "Edith Konecky, despite a
small body of work, can lay claim to a large literary achievement" (
<extref href="http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/konecky-edith">http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/konecky-edith</extref>) as she gives voice to a particular generation of women whose lives spanned a period of tremendous social, political, and economic change.</p>
