     <p>Founded in 1973 by Sherley Hollos Young (Smith '61) who served as Executive Director until it closed in 1995 when the landlord refused to renew the lease, the Women's Suburban Clinic in Paoli, Pennsylvania, was, according to its first brochure, "a nonprofit, outpatient facility offering an alternative to unwanted pregnancy."  By the 1990s, the Clinic was also offering educational programs and counseling services.  Beginning in 1982, anti-abortion activists were a regular feature outside the Clinic and hundreds were arrested throughout the 1980s, including 596 members of Operation Rescue in 1988.  Beyond the direct health services that the Women's Suburban Clinic provided, it was also instrumental in challenging Pennsylvania's strict abortion laws in a case that went all the way to the US Supreme Court in 1992 (<title render="italic">Planned Parenthood of SE Pennsylvania v. Casey</title>).</p>
