         <p>Mary Ritter Beard was born in Indianapolis on 5 August
    1876, the third of six children and the elder of two
    daughters of Narcissa (Lockwood) and Eli Foster Ritter. At
    sixteen she left home to attend De Pauw University in Asbury,
    Indiana, where she studied political science, languages, and
    literature. She graduated in 1897 and taught high school
    German until 1900 when she married Charles Austin Beard, whom
    she had met at De Pauw. Mary Beard accompanied her husband to
    Oxford, and both were active politically as well as
    academically. Charles helped organize Ruskin Hall, the "free
    university" aimed at workingmen, and Mary became involved
    with the British women's suffrage movement. They returned to
    New York in 1902. Their daughter Miriam was born in 1903. The
    following year the Beards enrolled at Columbia University,
    but Mary quit soon after to take care of their child and
    volunteer for progressive causes.</p>
 
         <p>Following the birth of her son William in 1907, Mary Beard
    became an organizer for the National Women's Trade Union
    League. From 1910 to 1912 she edited the suffragist
    periodical The Woman Voter, and after that worked with the
    Wage Earner's League. She was a member of the militant
    faction of the suffrage movement led by Alice Paul from 1913
    to 1919, and she worked on several progressive causes. During
    this period, Charles taught at Columbia University, but he
    resigned in 1917 in protest of the firing of anti-war
    faculty. Charles helped establish the New School for Social
    Research and both Beards helped found the Workers Education
    Bureau, but by the early 1920, the Beards generally worked
    outside of academic institutions.</p>

         <p>Following her resignation from the National Woman's Party
    in 1917, Mary Beard devoted her skills and efforts to writing
    and lecturing, rather than public political activity. Her
    first book, Woman's Work in Municipalities (1915) and her
    second, A Short History of the American Labor Movement
    (1920), focused on social reform and the working class. With
    Charles, she co-authored The Rise of American Civilization
    (1927), a groundbreaking text that integrated political,
    economic, social, and cultural histories with a progressive
    vision of America's past and distinctive national character.
    The two collaborated on several books that would become some
    of the most enduringly significant American history texts,
    but by herself, Mary pioneered the field of women's history.
    She was appalled by the omission of women from the historical
    record, and she wrote about and promoted the recognition of
    women's achievements in the present day and the past, in the
    U.S. and internationally. She authored and edited
    Understanding Women (1931), America Through Women's Eyes
    (1933), A Changing Political Economy as It Affects Women
    (1934), and Women as Force in History (1946), among
    others.</p>
         <p>Rather than concentrating on grievances and questions of
    the subjugation of women, Beard's work promoted women's
    contributions to the formation of society and brought to
    light a long-neglected past. To this end in the early 1930s,
    she collaborated with Hungarian pacifist feminist Rosika
    Schwimmer to organize the World Center for Women's Archives
    (WCWA). Beard quoted French historian Fustel de Coulanges for
    the motto of the WCWA: "No documents, no history," and she
    envisioned an archive of women's papers and organizational
    records that would provide a foundation for women's history
    as an academic field as well as serve as a public good. Beard
    and Schwimmer raised funds, founded a board of directors, and
    collected documents from their network of women activists.
    The WCWA was headquartered in New York but collected on an
    international level. It was a well-publicized effort, and
    though the collection specialized in material from the
    pacifist movement, Beard worked to realize a broader
    conception for a collection representing the range of women's
    activities. Factionalism among WCWA supporters, shaky
    financial support, and an increasingly militaristic
    atmosphere in the U.S. and abroad forced the dissolution of
    the WCWA in the early 1940s.</p>
         <p>This development was very discouraging to Beard, but
    fortunately, the WCWA generated momentum for developing
    institutions of women's history. Beard worked closely with
    Smith College archivist Margaret Grierson to create the
    Sophia Smith Collection, one of the world's largest women's
    history manuscript collections, founded in 1942, and she
    worked with Harvard historians to create the eventual
    Schlesinger Library at Radcliffe. These two institutions
    received many of the WCWA documents, as did several smaller
    collections. Together, they carried on the WCWA mission, at
    least partly due to Beard's influence.</p>
         <p>Neither of the Beards avoided controversy in their
    writings or public stands. Though both were well-respected
    historians, they increasingly drew criticism for their
    pacifist and progressive politics in the years surrounding
    World War II. Charles Beard died in 1948, and Mary Ritter
    Beard died on 14 August 1958. Both Beards have had enduring
    reputations as incisive historians, and they are recognized
    for their pioneering work in social history. Mary Beard
    especially has been celebrated for her work to promote
    women's history.</p>
         <p>Nancy Cott has written about Mary Beard as an activist,
    historian, and pioneer in the field of women's history in
    several articles and books, and she edited a volume of
    Beard's correspondence, A Woman Making History: Mary Beard
    through Her Letters (1991). Ann Lane's Mary Ritter Beard: A
    Sourcebook (1977) was edited and re-released in 2000 as
    Making Women's History: the Essential Mary Beard. Barbara
    Turoff's biography, Mary Beard as Force in History, was
    published in 1979.</p>

      <scopecontent id="scope">
         
         <p>The Mary Ritter Beard Papers are a small but significant
    collection of Beard's correspondence, writings, and materials
    from the World Center for Women's Archives (WCWA). Beard
    destroyed most of her personal papers. Nonetheless, what
    remains provides fascinating insight into one of the most
    significant American intellectuals of the twentieth century.
    Margaret Storrs Grierson, Smith College Archivist,
    established the Sophia Smith Collection (SSC), one the
    largest repositories for primary sources in women's history,
    in consultation with Beard. The documents in this collection
    pertain primarily to the years surrounding the demise of the
    WCWA and the founding of the Sophia Smith Collection.</p>
         <p>A small amount of biographical material includes
    photographs and clippings. The correspondence spans the
    mid-1940s to early 1950s. Letters exchanged between Beard,
    Dorothy [Dick] Brush, and Ethel Weed pertain to a proposed
    book on Japanese women's history. The project began as a
    collaboration between Brush and Beard. Beard ultimately
    authored Woman as Force in Japanese History (1953). Ethel
    Weed provided research assistance and served as a liaison
    between Beard and Shidzue Kato, a prominent Japanese activist
    and Diet member involved in the drafting of the Japanese
    Constitution following World War II.</p>
         <p>Correspondence between Beard, Margaret Grierson, and
    Grierson's companion Marine Leland offers special insight
    into Beard's personal life. The correspondence details
    Beard's professional life in the 1940s and 1950s as well. She
    deposited the materials from the defunct WCWA at Smith,
    Radcliffe College (at what would become the Schlesinger
    Library), and elsewhere, and the correspondence documents
    Beard's efforts to continue the mission of the WCWA. Beard
    and Grierson collaborated to establish the Sophia Smith
    Collection and sought each other's advice in their efforts to
    preserve and promote women's history. There is a microfilmed
    copy of Beard's outgoing correspondence that includes
    correspondence in the Beard Papers and other collections of
    the Sophia Smith Collection. See the Appendix at the end of
    this finding aid for a list of correspondents.</p>
         <p>The writings of Mary Beard include printed magazine
    articles and speeches. A typed and printed syllabus and
    bibliography prepared for the American Association of
    University Women analyzes the "Changing Political Economy as
    it Affects Women." There are also typescripts and research
    materials from various projects undertaken by Beard in the
    1940s, including notes on women in American history and a
    study of the representation of women in the Enclyclopedia
    Britannica. A significant amount of material was generated
    from the Japanese women's history project. The collection
    contains third party correspondence concerning research and
    the manuscript, typescripts of sections of the project, and
    research materials, including clippings about Shidzue Kato
    [see also incoming correspondence from Ethel Weed for notes from an
    interview of Kato]. The Papers contain printed copies of
    several of Beard's books, including those coauthored with
    Charles Beard.</p>
         <p>The last section of material concerns the World Center for
    Women's Archives. The materials in Beard Papers pertaining to
    the WCWA consist of correspondence, which includes letters to
    the general membership regarding the dissolution of the WCWA
    and letters between Mary Ritter Beard and donors to the
    archive; a file of general material; and a report from Dora
    Ettinger about women in Germany that was intended to become a
    WCWA document.</p>
