       <p>Cornelia A. (Babcock) Upton was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1854 and graduated from Providence, Rhode Island High School in 1874.  In 1882 she married Winslow Upton,  professor of astronomy at Brown University.  The couple had two daughters, Eleanor and Margaret (see below).  Upton's "chief interest" was the Auxiliary Board of Missions of the Episcopal Church.  Following the death of her husband in 1931, she lived with her daughter Eleanor in New Haven, Connecticut; she died there in 1941.</p>

	<p>Eleanor Stuart Upton was born in Lebanon Springs, New York in 1886.  She graduated from Smith College in 1909, obtained an M.A. from Brown University in 1910, and a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1930.  Between 1910 and 1914 she worked for a variety of social welfare organizations in Boston and Providence; as a tutor from 1914-16; and as a librarian at the John Carter Brown Library in Providence from 1916-21.  She became an assistant librarian at Yale University in 1921 and was a cataloger at the Forbes Library in Northampton, Massachusetts from 1952 to 1962.  She died in Hadley, Massachusetts, in 1974.</p>

	<p>Margaret Frances Upton was born in Providence, Rhode Island in 1890.  She graduated from  Smith College in 1912, obtained an M.A. from Brown University in 1914, and a Ph.D. from Yale University in 1925.  She taught science and bacteriology on the secondary and undergraduate level, and worked as a lab technician and research assistant, primarily at St. Luke's Hospital in Newburgh, New York and at Cooley Dickinson Hospital in Northampton, Massachusetts. She died in Hadley Massachusetts in 1967.</p>
