       <p>Katharine Idalia Asher was born 27 October 1898.  She was graduated from Smith College in 1920 and did graduate work in English at Oxford University from 1923 to 1924.  She was alumnae class president for thirteen years and in 1950 received an honorary degree from Smith College.  Engel held many offices in the National Council of Jewish Women, and was National President from 1949 to 1955.  She was on the boards of several other organizations, including Self-Help for Emigres from Central Europe, and United Service for New Americans.  In 1955 she was the only woman appointed to the New York State Committee on Refugees.  Among the Jewish fundraising groups benefiting from her volunteer service were the United Jewish Appeal and the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies.  Engel was an active member of numerous other groups, including the U.S. National Committee for UNESCO and the Advisory Committee for Women's Forces in Civil Defense.  Engel was married to Irving Engel, an attorney and chairman of the Executive Committee of the American Jewish Committee.  They had one daughter.  Katharine Engel died 30 March 1957. </p>
