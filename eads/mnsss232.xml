       <p>Pauline Avery Crawford was born in Cortland, NY on 8 Aug 1890, the daughter of a Methodist minister.  Educated at Goucher College, she taught for a year before her 1913
marriage to John Raymond Crawford, an archaeology professor at Columbia and Lafayette
Colleges; together, they had two sons, William (b. 1915) and Jack (b. 1921).  She and her
husband separated in the mid-1920s (he later committed suicide in 1929) and she and her two sons went to Europe.   As an American living in Paris from 1926 until her death in 1952, Crawford wrote for English-speaking publications, reporting on the Paris scene for, first <title render="italic">Vogue </title>magazine, then the <title render="italic">International Herald Tribun</title>e where she documented the impact of
World War II in verse and prose, including her own column, "Our Times in Rhyme" (1946-51).
After several years of failing health, including the loss of a leg after a botched operation
in 1931, Crawford died in Paris 14 Jan 1952.</p>
