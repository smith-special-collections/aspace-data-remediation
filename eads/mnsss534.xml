            Catholic nun; Lesbian activist; AIDS activist; National Gay and Lesbian Task Force director. Correspondence, reports, news coverage, speeches and speech notes, financial records, and photographs.  The Papers particularly well document the burgeoning AIDS crisis of the 1980s and the political response. The Papers also show well how the Gay and Lesbian Movement grew over time and gained wider acceptance as personified by this one woman's rise in relative political power from the State House in Albany to the White House in DC.

       <head>Biographical Note</head>
     <p>Virginia (Ginny) Apuzzo (b.1941) was raised in the Bronx, graduated with a B.A. from SUNY New
Paltz and an M.A. from Fordham University, and entered a convent at the age of 26. After leaving
the convent, Apuzzo came out publicly as a lesbian, taught at Brooklyn College, and dove head first
into movement politics. Working with the then-named National Gay Task Force, Apuzzo worked to have
a gay and lesbian plank included in the 1976 Democratic Party platform. Subsequently, she became
the Director of the Task Force, directing much of her attention to the AIDS crisis. Apuzzo's
impressive political accomplishments led to two decades of political appointments, first with the
Cuomo New York state administration and then the Clinton administration, where she was appointed
Assistant to the President for Administration and Management, making her the highest ranking out
lesbian in national government office to date. Apuzzo left this post in 1999 when she rejoined the
Task Force as the first holder of the Virginia Apuzzo Chair for Leadership in Public Policy.  In
2005, she was one of the founders of the Hudson Valley LGBTQ Community Center which opened in 2007
in Kingston, New York.  Also in 2007, then Govenor Eliot Spitzer appointed Apuzzo to the NYS
Commission on Public Integrity where she served through 2011.  She lived for many years in
Kingston, New York before moving to Florida in 2013.</p>
