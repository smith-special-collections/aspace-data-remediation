       <p>The Women's Program of the American Theatre Association was founded in 1980 for the purpose of establishing a network among women in both academic and professional theatre communities, including playwrights, directors, designers, and critics, in hopes of increasing production and job opportunities.  The program has held national conferences and annual meetings, providing a forum for the performance and critique of significant works by women in theatre in the U.S.  Six regional networks have been established, as well as a script and job referral service. The women involved in the organization have become resources for each other in providing opportunities for overall career advancement and for professional production opportunities, as well as for placing student interns in professional theatres.</p>
