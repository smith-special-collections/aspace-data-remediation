<p>The Gilbreth family goes for a ride, circa 1920</p></daodesc></dao>
         <p>Lillian Moller Gilbreth is perhaps most widely known as the mother of the Cheaper by the Dozen family but her talent and groundbreaking influence in the field of industrial engineering is her most remarkable achievement.  Lillian Moller was born in 1878 to William Moller, a partner in a large retail hardware business, and Annie Delger.  As a youth, she became interested in poetry and pursued her passion as an undergraduate.  In 1900, Lillian Moller graduated from the University of California with a degree in British literature.  She then attended Columbia University for graduate study in English literature.  Two years later she was awarded a Master's degree.  In 1903, she met Frank Bunker Gilbreth, a cousin of her chaperone.  Frank Gilbreth had risen from an apprentice bricklayer to become a well-known contractor through his labor-saving techniques and ingenuity.  The couple married in 1904 and soon thereafter embarked upon a joint career in industrial engineering.  After publishing two books, Motion Study (1911) and Primer of Scientific Management (1912), the couple moved from Boston to Providence, Rhode Island where they founded Gilbreth, Incorporated, a consulting engineering firm.  Lillian M. Gilbreth received her Ph.D. in industrial psychology from Brown University in 1915.  Lillian and Frank Gilbreth were popular lecturers and spoke at many conventions and universities on the subject of motion saving techniques and worker efficiency with respect to both physical ability and psychological variables.  Lillian Gilbreth stressed the "human element in management" and believed that the individual worker was more responsive to recognition of good performance than to threats of punishment.  This type of positive discipline was integral to the Gilbreth method of management, which they practiced both professionally and also in their domestic life.  Between 1905 and 1922, Lillian Gilbreth gave birth to twelve children, eleven of whom survived to adulthood.  In 1924, Frank Gilbreth died suddenly of a heart attack.  Lillian attempted to continue their consulting business.  She experienced so much discrimination in her attempt to go solo in an overwhelmingly male profession, that she began concentrating on issues of homemaking.  Gilbreth published two books on the subject, The Home-Maker and Her Job (1927) and Management in the Home (1954).  Gilbreth and her husband were also concerned with the needs of disabled individuals.  While he was still alive, they published several articles on disabled soldiers and Gilbreth continued this thread by designing equipment and motion saving methods to make household tasks easier for disabled people.  She also published two books on this subject, Normal Lives for the Disabled (1933) which she co-authored with Edna Yost, her friend and later biographer, and Straight Talk for Disabled Veterans (1945).  Despite the obstacles faced by a woman in the field of engineering, Gilbreth's career flourished.  She was appointed professor of management at Purdue University in 1935 and also was a member of the faculty at Newark College of Engineering from 1941-43. She also volunteered for many groups and organizations, including the Girl Scouts of America. Throughout her career, Gilbreth won many awards and was a popular speaker.  She died in 1972 at the age of 83.</p>

         <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
         <p>The Lillian Moller Gilbreth Papers consist of 6.5 linear feet of material dating from the late 1860s through 1999.  The collection contains both personal and professional papers. Ernestine Gilbreth Carey, her third daughter, has been instrumental in both the documentation and publicity of her mother's career.  Carey is the author of two books that describe her unusual upbringing,  Cheaper by the Dozen (1948), which she co-authored with her brother Frank Gilbreth, Jr., and Belles on Their Toes (1950).  Carey gathered most of the material in this collection in preparation for a biography of her mother.  Many of the documents contain notes that reflect Carey's process as a writer and researcher.</p>
         <p>The Lillian Moller Gilbreth Papers at the Sophia Smith Collection are closely associated with the Ernestine Gilbreth Carey Papers also housed here.  A more extensive archive of Lillian Gilbreth is located in the Department of Special Collections and Archives at Purdue University Library.</p>

               <p>The material in this series is divided into five
          subseries: General, Writings about Gilbreth, Family,
          Death, and Awards, commemorations, remembrances, and
          tributes. The material under the General heading includes
          notebooks, memorabilia, date books, address books,
          itineraries, and a curriculum vita.</p>
               <p>The Writings about Gilbreth are rather extensive and
          include scholarly works, articles published in trade
          magazines, works representing the influence of the
          Gilbreth method in the field of management, and newspaper
          clippings. Of particular interest are the scholarly
          writings by Laurel D. Graham, which discuss Gilbreth's
          career and the extent of her influence.</p>
               <p>The material pertaining to the Gilbreth Family
          includes a family log, a variety of recollections, and
          material that reflects the unique Gilbreth method of
          child-rearing. The daily schedules, typewriting
          instructions, and especially the "Bi-Man" and "The
          Ambidextrous" magazines created by the children reflect
          the ways in which the emphasis on efficient time and
          motion management characterized the Gilbreth home.</p>
               <p>The subseries that pertains to Gilbreth's Death is
          comprised mainly of obituaries, numerous letters of
          condolence, and memorial gifts. Arranged alphabetically,
          the final subsereries, Awards, commemorations,
          remembrance, and tributes, accounts for nearly half of
          all the biographical material contained in this series.
          While Gilbreth received many honors and awards during her
          lifetime, the bulk of the material represents posthumous
          recognition. Especially noteworthy is the material
          pertaining to the 1984 Gilbreth commemorative stamp;
          Ernestine Carey, Gilbreth's daughter, spearheaded this
          initiative and the organizational schemes of many of the
          letters and virtually all of the notes pertaining to this
          endeavor are Carey's creation.</p>

               <p>This series is divided into two subseries, Family and
          Friends and associates. While there is some
          correspondence between Gilbreth and her sister, Annie
          Moller Cross, her husband, and her other children, the
          bulk of the family correspondence is with her daughter,
          Ernestine Gilbreth Carey [closed until 2013], dating from
          1925, when Carey was a student at Smith College, to 1968,
          at which point the ailing Gilbreth moved in with her
          daughter, Ernestine Carey, before taking up her final
          residence at the Beatitudes nursing home.</p>
               <p>The correspondence between Gilbreth and her Friends
          and associates is sparse, with the exceptions of that
          with her most prominent protégé, Bo Casten Carlberg, and
          her long-time friend, Jewel C. Hardkopf.</p>

               <p>This series is organized into two subseries, Speeches
          and Writings. The transcripts of her speeches span the
          dates of her solo career and provide excellent insight
          into the specifics of her management theories; they also
          offer a glimpse of her personality. Gilbreth's personal
          life is more apparent in her autobiographical writings
          and the memoir of her husband, The Quest for the One Best
          Way. This subseries also contains professional writings
          she authored individually and a selection of those she
          wrote in collaboration with her husband. Some of the
          latter bear only the name of Frank Gilbreth as author.
          These are included because, as Frank himself
          acknowledged, Lillian's professional input was a factor
          in virtually everything he published.</p>
