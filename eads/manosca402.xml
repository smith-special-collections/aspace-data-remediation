	<p>Helen Wright graduated from Smith College in 1905.  While a student, she was active in the many clubs and committees on campus, including as a member of the Blue Pencil, Novel Cub, the Glee Club, the Chapel Choir, and the Junior Prom Music Committee, as the chairman of Religious Service Committee in the Smith College Association for Christian Work (SCACW) and as Assistant Stage Manager for the 1905 Senior Dramatics.  Wright worked as General Secretary of SCACW from 1913-1917 and then for the appointment bureau, now the Career Development Office, from 1917 to 1924.  Wright left Smith to teach math at Santa Barbara School for Girls, but returned to receive her masters in math.  Wright taught at Northfield School for girls in the early '30's and was head of the math department until her retirement in 1948.  In retirement, Wright dedicated her time to service as a fund agent, a secretary of her class, and as director of College Cevenol, a French house devoted to developing the values of world peace and Christian morality in its students.  She died in 1979.</p>
