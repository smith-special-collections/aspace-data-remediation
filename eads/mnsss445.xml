     <p>Diann L. Neu was born in 1948.  She earned her Masters in Clinical Social Work from The Catholic University of America, her Master of Sacred Theology degree from The Jesuit School of Theology at Berkeley, and her Doctor of Ministry in International Feminist Theology from the San Francisco Theological Seminary.  Trained in liturgy and spirituality, she has done extensive work in designing liturgies for national and international conferences as well as for her own women-church base community in the Washington, DC area.   In 1983, Neu and her partner, Mary E. Hunt, founded the Women's Alliance for Theology, Ethics, and Ritual (WATER) in Silver Spring, MD.  In private practice as a psychotherapist, as well as in her affiliation with WATER, she counsels women and men from widely divergent backgrounds in individual, couple, and group sessions.  Neu lectures and conducts workshops throughout the United States, in Latin America and Europe, and has published numerous books of rituals and articles on the subject of feminist approaches to liturgy, spirituality, and therapy. She has received many awards for her work and is the author of two books, <title render="italic">Women's Rites: Feminist Liturgies for Life's Journey</title>  (2002) and <title render="italic">Return Blessings: Ecofeminist Liturgies Renewing the Earth</title> (2003). Her publications from WATERworks Press are <title render="italic">Peace Liturgies</title>; <title render="italic">Gathered at Sophia's Table: A Feminist Peace Seder</title>; <title render="italic">Women-Church Sourcebook</title>; <title render="italic">Women of Fire: A Pentecost Event</title>; <title render="italic">Women and the Gospel Traditions</title>; <title render="italic">Women-Church Celebrations</title>; <title render="italic">A Seder of the Sisters of Sarah</title>; <title render="italic">Miriam's Sisters Rejoice</title>; and 	<title render="italic">Together at Freedom's Table</title>.</p>
