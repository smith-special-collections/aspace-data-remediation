       <head>Biographical Note</head>
     <p>Amelia ("Amy") Richards was born in Alexandria, Virginia on Feb. 9, 1970 and grew up in a
working-class family in Pennsylvania.  Her father, Albert Wentz, was not part of her life and she
was raised by her single mother, Karen Richards.  Amy Richards would go on to attend Tabor Academy,
a prep school in Marion, Mass., before graduating cum laude from Barnard College in 1992.  An art
history major at Barnard, Richards was nonetheless drawn to a life of activism, starting with her
involvement with Freedom Summer '92, a nation-wide voter registration campaign, the first
organizing effort of the then recently formed Third Wave Direct Action Corporation which later
became known as the Third Wave Foundation.  In addition to Richards, other co-founders included
Rebecca Walker and Catherine Gund.  Richards has written the advice column "Ask Amy" for
www.feminist.com since 1997 and has written and co-written three books: <title render="italic">Manifesta: Young Women,
Feminism and the Future</title> (2000) and <title render="italic">Grassroots: A Field Guide for Feminist Activism</title> (2004), both
with Jennifer Baumgardner; and <title render="italic">Opting In: Having a Child Without Losing Yourself</title> (2008).
Richards has published numerous articles in various publications, including <title render="italic">The Nation</title>, <title render="italic">Bust</title>,
<title render="italic">The New York Times</title>, and <title render="italic">Ms.</title>  She is regularly interviewed as the "face" of young feminism at
the end of the 20th and start of the 21st centuries, appearing on television show such as "The O'Reilly Factor" and "Oprah." Richards has for twenty years assisted Gloria Steinem in multiple projects and she has also worked with Anna Deavere Smith.  She founded and directs Soapbox, Inc: Speakers Who Speak Out, a feminist lecture agency, based in New York City.  According to her biography on the Soapbox Inc. Web site, Richards "is also a four-time marathon runner, a former NCAA Division I soccer player, an avid traveler, and a mother of two sons."
