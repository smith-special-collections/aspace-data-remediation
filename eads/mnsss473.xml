	<p>Ruth Frances Woodsmall was born in Atlanta, Georgia, September 20, 1883, the youngest of three children of Harrison S. Woodsmall, a lawyer and teacher, and Mary Elizabeth Howes, an art teacher.  She grew up in Indianapolis, Indiana and attended local schools. She received her A.B. from the University of Nebraska in 1905 and her A.M. from Wellesley in 1906.  From 1906 to 1917 she worked as a high school English teacher and principal in Nevada and Colorado.  Beginning in 1917 and for the next 30 years (with the exception of 1928-32) Woodsmall held various positions with the National and World YWCA.  As a member of the National Board of the YWCA of the United States, she worked with the War Work Council directing Hostess Houses in the United States and France during World War I. From 1918 to 1920 she did post war work and field studies of the Baltic and Balkan countries. In 1920 Woodsmall became executive secretary of the Near and Middle East, a post she held until 1928. In 1928 she received a traveling fellowship from the Rockefeller Foundation to conduct a study of the changing status of Moslem women in the Middle East. Her 1930 report was later published in 1936 as <title render="italic">Moslem Women Enter a New World</title>. In 1930 Woodsmall participated in the Laymen's Foreign Mission Inquiry, an independent ecumenical project of the Protestant churches to assess missionaries' record in converting non-western populations. Her <title render="italic">Eastern Women Today and Tomorrow</title> (1933) contained the results of this project. In 1932 Woodsmall returned to the YWCA as staff specialist for the National Board, and in 1935 she became General Secretary for the World YWCA, a post she held until 1947. Between 1947 and 1948 she did special service for the YWCA in Japan.</p>

<p>In 1949 Woodsmall became Chief of the Women's Affairs Section of the U.S. High Commission for Occupied Germany, a position she held until 1952.  She was appointed by the Department of State to the U.N. Commission on the Status of Women for two sessions in 1949 and 1952. In 1951 she was a member of the UNESCO Working Party on the Equality of Access of Women to Education. In the years following her retirement she continued her research and writings, updating her earlier research in <title render="italic">Study of the Role of Women, Their Activities and Organizations in Lebanon, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, and Syria</title> (1955) and <title render="italic">Women and the New East</title> (1960).  She died in New York City on May 25, 1963.</p>

They reflect HICOG work with German women to prepare them for citizenship and leadership in postwar Germany and the problems of displaced and refugee populations. The field surveys of the Balkans and the Near East as well as surveys of migration conditions in Switzerland, Italy, France, and Belgium are of particular interest as well as  research notes and reports on the conditions of women compiled for the World YWCA.</p>

			<p>This series is divided into four subseries: <title render="bold">Diaries</title>, <title render="bold">Notes</title>, <title render="bold">Speeches and broadcast</title>s, and <title render="bold">Publications and reports</title>. The Diaries subseries contains 44 volumes (1905-62) plus loose pages (1942-43, 1954).  These range from line-a-days in the early 1900s with longer entries beginning in the early teens. These personal narratives combined with Woodsmall's correspondence and notes provide an excellent and well rounded view of her life and activities. The <title render="bold">Note</title>s subseries is divided into two sections: Countries and Miscellaneous. The countries section consists of notes on China, Egypt, Greece, India, New Zealand, and Russia. Although these may be related to research for her publications or her professional work, their origin is unidentified. The miscellaneous notes consist of eight notebooks some of which are in diary form. In addition there are notes from an economics course she took in Geneva, notes on student themes (Turkey, Egypt, Persia, Jerusalem, India), the United Nations, and miscellaneous and unidentified items.</p>
			<p>There are eight folders in the <title render="bold">Speeches and broadcasts</title> subseries arranged by date. </p>

			<p>The "Changing Status of Moslem Women" was conducted with the support of a Rockefeller Grant in 1928. The scope of the study was to ascertain the general trends of change affecting the position of Moslem women in the Near and Middle East and India. It was primarily based on interviews. This section consists of correspondence, notes, reports, reviews, drafts, manuscripts and typescripts, and interviews. Of particular interest are the interviews, statistics, and reports done for the project and student essays on Moslem women.</p> 
			<p><title render="italic">Moslem Women Enter the New World</title> (1936) represents a composite of research done for the Rockefeller Grant and during Woodsmall's years of service with the YWCA. This section contains correspondence, drafts, reports, reviews, and publicity. </p>
			<p><title render="italic">Study of the Role of Women in Lebanon, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan and Syria</title> (1955) updated her earlier research.  Of particular interest are the interviews regarding progress of women in the Middle East between the World Wars and into the 1950s.   </p>
			<p><title render="italic">Women and the New East</title> (1960) includes correspondence and reports, but of particular interest are interviews on the status of women in Afghanistan, India,  Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Pakistan, and Turkey.	</p>
			<p>The Miscellaneous writings include an entry for the <title render="italic">Encyclopedia Britannica</title> on "Harem," an interview with Eleanor Roosevelt, and three articles: "That They May Not Have Died In Vane," "With The Peoples of France," and "Women in the New Germany."</p></scopecontent>

			<p>This series is divided into six subseries: <title render="bold">Ruth Woodsmall</title>, <title render="bold">Family</title>, <title render="bold">Friends and associates</title>, <title render="bold">Public figures</title>, <title render="bold">Professional activities</title>, and <title render="bold">Subjects</title>. The photographs of Ruth Woodsmall are divided into two sections: alone and in groups. There are personal photos dating from childhood and YWCA publicity photographs. The group photos consist of Woodsmall with groups in Australia and at HICOG, plus miscellaneous identified and unidentified group shots. The <title render="bold">Family</title> subseries contains photographs of Helen Woodsmall Eldredge, Marlen Eldredge Neumann and her family and friends, Hubert H. Woodsmall, and Mary Elizabeth Howes Woodsmall. There is also a folder of miscellaneous and unidentified family photos.</p>
			<p>The <title render="bold">Friends and associates</title> subseries is arranged alphabetically by individual. There are also a large number of unidentified photos in this subseries. </p>
			<p>The <title render="bold">Public figures</title> subseries contains photos of Lakshmi Menon, Jawaharlal Nehru, Vijayalakshmi Pandit, Eleanor Roosevelt, plus miscellaneous photos. </p>
			<p><title render="bold">Professional activities</title> subseries is divided in three sections: YWCA, U.S. High Commissioner for Germany, and United Nations.  </p>
			<p>There are three sections in the <title render="bold">Subject</title> subseries: Conferences, Countries, World War I, and World War II. The bulk of the photographs are contained in the Countries, World War I and World War II sections. Woodsmall traveled widely, especially for the YWCA and for the Laymen's Foreign Mission Inquiry. The countries section contains a substantial collection of photographs from twenty countries, especially China and Turkey. Although many have minimal identification and/or are undated, they provide a rich and valuable insight into the status of women especially in the Middle and Far East. Photographs for Women and the New East are located in this section. The World War I section contains British photographs of farm workers and war industries as well as war work in France. The World War II section contains photographs of WAACs and WRENs, scenes, and war work.</p>
