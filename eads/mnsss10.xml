         <p>Mina Kirstein Curtiss was born in Boston, Massachusetts on October 13, 1896 to Louis Kirstein, an optician, and Rose Stein.  She had two younger brothers, Lincoln Kirstein, founder and general director of the New York City Ballet, and George Kirstein, publisher of the Liberal Weekly.  The family moved to Rochester, NY in 1901 and remained there until 1912, when they returned to Boston and Louis Kirstein became a partner in Filene's Department Store.  Curtiss was schooled at home by a governess until 1912, when she was sent to Northampton, Massachusetts to attend Miss Capen's School.  She graduated from Smith College in 1918 and went on to earn an MA in English from Columbia University in 1920.</p>
         <p>Prior to attending Columbia, Curtiss worked as a research clerk for Military Intelligence in Washington, D.C., from 1918 to 1920.  She lived at the headquarters of the National Woman Suffrage Association where she became friends with Anna Howard Shaw and Carrie Chapman Catt.  Curtiss married Henry Tomlinson Curtiss in 1926 only to be devastated by his untimely death a year later, in 1927.  In 1933 she published <title render="italic">The Midst of Life</title>, a book that took the form of a series of letters to her dead husband.   From 1922 to 1934 and again from 1940 to 1942, Curtiss was a beloved and highly regarded professor of English at Smith College, returning in 1976, at the age of 81, as Visiting Professor of English Language and Literature to teach a course on writing biography. From 1935 to 1939, she worked with Orson Welles and John Houseman in researching and writing scripts for the Mercury Theatre of the Air.  In 1942, she created a program for the <title render="italic">Des Moines Register and Tribune</title> radio station, based on soldiers' letters home.  This evolved into a book, Letters Home, edited by Curtiss and published in 1944.  In 1942 Curtiss also joined the Office of War Information and, with Houseman, developed a short wave radio program for the BBC entitled "Answering You," in which celebrities responded to questions submitted by BBC listeners.</p>
         <p>Rather than return to teaching when World War II ended, Curtiss opted to pursue a career in writing, authoring books, journal articles, and book reviews for national and international audiences.   She was also fluent in French, and translated and edited works by several noted Frenchmen, including Edgar Degas, Philip Halevy, Marcel Proust, and Alexis Leger (also known as Saint-John Perse).  She once said in an interview, "I fall in love with whatever I'm working on," and this passion, combined with a rigorous intellect, made her a tireless, tenacious, and meticulous researcher.  Having read Proust and translated his letters for publication in the United States (<title render="italic">The Letters of Marcel Proust</title>, 1949), Curtiss was inspired to go to Paris to seek out Proust's family and friends still living, and to unearth more of his correspondence.  This research led to publication in 1978 of <title render="italic">Other People's Letters: A Memoir</title> and to an interest in the composer Georges Bizet, which Curtiss pursued with characteristic vigor.</p>
         <p>Following publication of <title render="italic">Other People's Letters: A Memoir</title> in 1978, Curtiss continued to write.  She submitted several manuscripts for publication ("Winter Letters," a sequel to <title render="italic">Midst of Life</title>; "The Past and I" and "Slices of Life," sequential autobiographies; and "Plato: Archbishop of Moscow," a biographical sketch that evolved from researching <title render="italic">A Forgotten Empress: Anna Ivanovich and Her Era</title>, 1730-1740), and to her disappointment all were rejected.  Despite a severe heart condition that left her bedridden for the last several years of her life, with the help of her secretary Curtiss continued to edit and modify the manuscripts in hopes that they would eventually go to press.</p>
         <p>In addition to teaching and pursuing a career in writing, Curtiss was generous to causes in which she believed, to the extent that her finances allowed.  In 1964, she donated most of the land that comprised Chapelbrook, her farm in Ashfield, Massachusetts, to the Trustees of Reservations, before selling the house and remaining acreage privately. She also founded the Chapelbrook Foundation the purpose of which was to provide funding to writers over the age of forty, to enable them to complete works in progress that might otherwise have gone unfinished.  Curtiss also donated manuscript material to libraries and repositories, and works of art to museums.</p>
         <p>In 1984, Smith College alumnae Anne Morrow Lindbergh and her sister, Constance Morrow Morgan, organized a campaign among Curtiss's former students to raise funds for a tribute to her.  The response was overwhelming and led to establishment of the Mina Curtiss Fund, thanks to which a vase of fresh flowers, replaced on a regular basis in perpetuity, graces the Browsing Room in the William Allan Neilson Library at Smith College.  Curtiss herself was an avid gardener and, not long before she died, suggested that the tribute take this form.</p>
         <p>Mina Kirstein Curtiss died in Connecticut on October 31, 1985.</p>

         <p>The Mina Kirstein Curtiss Papers consist of 11 linear feet and date from 1913 to 1986.  Types of material include biographical information, including an oral history; personal and professional correspondence; photographs; journals and diaries; financial records; clippings; and typescripts of writings.  The papers are arranged in six series: Biographical Material, Photographs, Correspondence, Teaching, Writings and Subject Files.</p>
         <p>The bulk of the papers dates from 1933 to 1985 and focuses on Curtiss's writing career. It includes correspondence with publishers and researchers, research material, artwork, royalty statements, and typescripts.  The typescripts are edited in Curtiss's hand and provide insight into her creative and analytical processes.  Correspondence is also extensive and reflects the many friendships Curtiss developed while teaching, and in researching and writing her various books and attempting to see them through to publication.  Many of the correspondents are people of note. The correspondence also well illustrates Curtiss's analytical approach to her topics of research.</p>
         <p>Although the diaries and journals in this collection are limited in scope, they do reveal something of their author's passionate nature and discerning intellect, as well as some of her struggles and disappointments.</p>
         <p>The photographs are also of interest, offering a glimpse into Curtiss's childhood and early family life, as well as life at Chapelbrook, the Curtiss home in Ashfield, Massachusetts.</p>
         <p>The financial records document the acquisition of art and antiques, and the necessity for Curtiss to sell certain pieces later in her life, when she faced financial difficulties.  They are also evidence of Curtiss's generosity in donating books, manuscript material and artwork to appropriate institutions when she was financially secure.</p>

               <p>This series provides an overview of Mina Kirstein Curtiss's private life and includes legal documents, an oral history, and photographs.  The series also contains two bound volumes of poetry, some of which is in Curtiss's hand and the rest in another, unidentified hand. There is also correspondence pertaining to the Mina K.Curtiss Fund at Smith College, established in 1984.  The financial information is extensive and includes tax returns; bills of sale, receipts, and appraisals for art and antiques; and records of donations made to various museums and libraries.  Also included is a set of Curtiss's daily appointment calendars, spanning the years 1936 to 1985; the year 1939 is missing.  There are also magazine articles, correspondence, drawings, legal documents, and printed matter relating to various properties Curtiss owned during her life, most of which concern Chapelbrook in Ashfield, Massachusetts.  The Chapelbrook photograph albums are filed in this series because they are germane to to that particular property and because many of the photographs depict life there before Mina Stein Kirstein married Henry Tomlinson Curtiss in 1926.</p>

Although most of the images are undated and the people in them are unidentified, they well illustrate certain aspects of Curtiss's family life and leisure activities.</p>

               <p>This series is divided into four subseries: Family, Friends and acquaintances, Legal and financial, and Miscellaneous.  In the Family subseries, letters to "Goosie" and "Pettikins" probably refer to Lincoln and George Kirstein, respectively. The bulk of the series consists of Friends and acquaintances and includes letters from many eminent figures from the literary world.  Letters to family and to Smith College President William Allan Neilson are especially revealing of Curtiss's thoughts and feelings as she grappled with personal problems.  Legal and financial correspondence is comprised of letters between Curtiss and the prominent Boston firms that represented her legal and fiscal interests.  Since Curtiss traveled extensively, whenever practicable on incoming correspondence her whereabouts have been noted in pencil above the greeting.

               <p>This series consists of diaries and journals; draft manuscripts and typescripts; research materials; artwork for illustrating Curtiss's books; book reviews, both by Curtiss and by others about her books; journal articles; fan mail, and correspondence with publishers, literary agents, and research associates.  A significant amount of material in this series relates to unpublished works. Some of the artwork filed under "Manet Caricatures: Olympia" was not actually used in the published version of that article, which appeared in the <title render="italic">Massachusetts Review</title> in 1966.  It is unknown whether Curtiss decided against using this material in the "Olympia" article, or if she intended all along to use it in subsequent vignettes or in the proposed book on Manet caricatures.   Since Curtiss filed this artwork with illustrations that were used in the "Olympia" article, it has been retained there.</p>
               <p>Material pertaining to <title render="italic">The Midst of Life</title> contains an untitled essay that Curtiss had identified as "background material--<title render="italic">Midst of Life</title>;" the essay has therefore been filed with other papers having to do with <title render="italic">The Midst of Life</title>. "Winter Letters," which never reached publication, was the sequel to <title render="italic">The Midst of Life</title>.</p>
               <p>"Slices of Life" is a sequel to the "Past and I."  Both are autobiographies, neither of which was ever published. The manuscript "Platon: Archbishop of Moscow" was originally part of "Slices of Life," but Curtiss separated it and submitted it for publication, also unsuccessfully, as a separate manuscript; the "Platon" material is therefore filed immediately after the "Slices of Life" typescript.  </p>
               <p>Much of the correspondence between Curtiss and Liliane Yacoel Ziegel, Curtiss's Parisian research associate, is in French, particularly that pertaining to <title render="italic">Letters of Marcel Proust and Bizet and His World</title>.</p>
               <p>Correspondence with publishers and literary agents comprises a separate subseries due to its broad and varied content, particularly the letters between Curtiss and Al Hart of the Fox Chase Agency.</p>
               <p>Research material for <title render="italic">Letters Home</title> consists of typescripts of letters soldiers wrote either to their hometown newspapers or to their families.  Material pertaining to the radio program, "What's YOUR Idea," and to a column in <title render="italic">Cosmopolitan </title>called "Letters Home," both of which evolved from the huge success of <title render="italic">Letters Home</title>, is filed with other documents relating to the book.</p>
