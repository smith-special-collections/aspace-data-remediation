	<p>Mira Bigelow Wilson graduated from Abbot Academy in 1910 and entered Smith College the same year.  She graduated from Smith in 1914 and took a positon as English and History teacher in Curtis-Peabody School in the same year.  She left in 1916 to study at Boston University School of Theology, where she earned her STB in 1918 and was the only woman to do so in her class.  In 1919, Wilson returned to Smith to be the General Secretary of the Smith College Association for Christian Work (S.C.A.C.W.).  During her time at Smith, she was a class dean for the class of 1923, and became Director of Religious and Social Services in 1928.  In 1929, Wilson left Smith to become President of Northfield Seminary, but continued her service to the college as Alumnae trustee in 1942.  She also continued her education while at Northfield, earning her LL.D. from Smith in 1938 and was honored with a L.H.D. from Wilson College in 1951.  She retired from Northfield in 1952 and died in 1953.</p>

	<p>The collection contains the professional and personal papers of Mira Bigelow Wilson dating from her student years as a member of the class of 1914 to her death in 1953.  Although the collection contains some news clippings about her career, short articles, and various photographs, the majority of the collection is made up of correspondence, both professional and personal, speeches, and a series of "Helter Skelter" Journals that Wilson kept from her time as a student until 1920.</p>
