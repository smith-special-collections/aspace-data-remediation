        <p>Born in Birmingham, Alabama in 1922, Marge Frantz has been a lifelong activist.  Introduced   to radical politics and the Communist Party by her father Joe Gelders, Frantz's activism began   early, with the Young Communist League in 1935.  Frantz's Party activity ranged from selling the   Daily Worker on the New York City subway to organizing the Alabama delegation to the American   Youth Congress. Frantz finally left the Party in 1956, though her agitation far from ceased.   She was an organizer for the United Electrical Workers, campaigned for Wallace, worked for   Planned Parenthood, was a part of the free speech movement in Berkeley, and a stalwart of the   peace movement.  After she and husband Laurent (also a radical and former CP member) had four   children, Frantz returned to college (graduating from Berkeley in 1972) and went on to a PhD   from the University of California, Santa Cruz, where she spent three decades as a celebrated and   inspirational teacher.  Frantz retired from teaching, but continued her activism, and is living  with her partner Eleanor in Santa Cruz.</p>
