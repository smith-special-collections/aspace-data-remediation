            <p>by

      </p>

<p>It is thanks to the Centennial Committee of a small core of professional colleagues convened by Jack Kamaiko; to Vida S. Grayson, oral historian, Smith College School for Social Work; and to Dorothy Green, research associate, and Susan Grigg, director, Sophia Smith Collection, that Bertha Capen Reynolds and her writings are being resurrected from virtual oblivion.  The centennial programs are to commemorate her birth and her achievements as scholar, teacher, and writer like no other; and to introduce recent generations of students and practitioners, and those to follow, to her rich, thought-provoking, trail? blazing contributions to the social work literature and to the teaching and practice of social work.  It would be logical for these people to ask, as some have, why they had not known about so eminent a person during the course of their education and training.</p>

<p>In historical perspective, reasons tend to become obscured or rationalized; but stripped to raw essence, it is for the reason that for the later period of her productive years a conspiracy of silent ostracism, not unlike a gentlemen's agreement, prevailed among the established leadership in the profession and among the prestigious schools of social work and social agencies; and her writings were omitted from the reading lists of schools of social work.  The consequences were two-fold: the loss to students of original and stimulating learning materials; and the loss to Bertha C. Reynolds of her lifeline to all levels of contacts that she characterized as "nourishing," as well as the loss of the means of earning a livelihood.</p>

<p>Because such a phenomenon had not occurred in the profession before Bertha C. Reynolds's time and has not occurred since, as far as I know, an explanation is in order.  Her writings trace the historical events and the process which brought her to self-liberation from the constraints of time-honored doctrine.</p>

<p>She believed that catastrophes like war, cyclic economic depression, chronic poverty, hunger, and a host of others, and their effects upon the human condition, and on a global scale, are but the symptoms of underlying causes which are rooted in societal values and systems; therefore, the searchlight should be beamed on, and work directed to, the elimination of the causes. Moreover, social work, the profession most intimately knowledgeable about the tolls of such disasters in human misery, and deeply involved in its alleviation, has a role in helping to change value systems in a society which tolerates the degradation of body and spirit of masses of humanity.  These principles were (and still are) in sharp contrast to those held acceptable by individuals and groups in power.  But what "cooked her goose," to quote a phrase, was that she used Marxist ideology as a frame of reference for her beliefs and its science of society as the key to the solution of such widespread socio-economic-political disasters.  And, she dared to present her views in public!  Yet paradoxical as it may seem, her abiding faith in her beloved America, and in its people, and in the profession, to show the way to the changes needed for a better world for all peoples, never wavered.  "This book is dedicated to an unbreakable tie with the interests of humanity" is the dedication in her book, <title render="italic">Social Work and Social Living</title>.</p>

<p>The legacy of the writings of Bertha C. Reynolds to her profession contains searching questions and insightful, incisive answers which are as relevant, if not more so, to today's world as when they were written.  Is this legacy worth her sacrifices of creature comforts and of the acclaim which undoubtedly would have been hers had she made compromises to conformity; will it enlighten and inspire others to creative thinking, and to the courage to speak out for infusion of new ideas, without which a profession remains static?  I asked her several months before her death, what message would she send to young people entering the profession today?  Her response was, "Do not get locked into traditional molds."</p>

<p>Bertha C. Reynolds's writings attest to the wisdom in the Confucian saying, in paraphrase: to understand the present and the future, one must study and know the past.  The inference is that the past is a harbinger of the present and the future, the three being linked in a continuum.  Judgments as to the veracity of this linkage and its manifestations (as her writings indicate) will no doubt vary when examined in the light of the contemporary American and world scene. But beyond doubt is the rare treat which is in store for those who study her writings for the first time.</p>

            <p>Bertha C. Reynolds died at home in Stoughton on October 29, 1978.</p>
        </bioghist>

      <scopecontent id="scope">
         
         <p>The Bertha C. Reynolds Papers consist of correspondence, writings, printed materials, memorabilia, and miscellaneous papers.  They are concentrated in the period following Reynolds's appointment as associate director of the Smith College School for Social Work in 1925 and are strongest for her final decades in Stoughton.</p>
         <p>The most outstanding segment of the papers is Reynolds's correspondence with her friends and former students.  The letters addressed to her are mainly from the 1960s and 1970s, but her own letters include sequences from the 1930s and 1940s (saved by those who received them).  This correspondence is distinguished by its long and thoughtful discussions of professional, political, and religious topics as well as by reports on personal activities.  The political and religious interests also appear in printed material gathered over the years and in unpublished writings.</p>
         <p>Direct documentation of Reynolds's social work teaching and writing is excellent for some kinds of activities and significant for all others.  Her work as associate director of the Smith College School for Social Work is represented by correspondence with Director Everett Kimball spanning the entire period and by notes for an alumnae seminar.  Many of her lectures and her contributions to institutes, conferences, and seminars are documented by unpublished texts as well as by correspondence and printed materials.  The items related to her published writings consist mainly of correspondence and copies of the publications, but there are also a few manuscripts and typescripts.  Her work at the National Maritime Union is represented by staff minutes and position papers, printed material, and correspondence following the termination of the program; this section provides the best documentation of her approach to clinical practice.  Her independent consultations are documented in such materials as speeches, correspondence, and brochures, but there are no immediate records of this professional work.  Many of these activities are also treated in letters to friends and in autobiographical writings.</p>
         <p>Other papers document Reynolds's earlier and later years.  Her youth is represented by a diary she compiled retrospectively from family letters, by an unpublished autobiography, and by a few of her undergraduate papers.  Aside from her retrospective writings, there is nothing for the period between her graduation from Smith in 1908 and her return in 1918. Her final years in Stoughton are well documented in correspondence, writings, and printed materials about her work on behalf of the Stoughton Fair Housing and Human Rights Association, the Stoughton Historical Society, and the Methodist Church; in correspondence and printed material concerning the honors that she received in the 1960s and 1970s; and also in the aforementioned correspondence with friends.</p>

               <p>The first section contains case studies used at Danvers State Hospital.</p>
               <p>Reynolds's work at the Smith College School for Social Work is represented by papers related to a seminar for alumnae, correspondence with Everett Kimball, and two case histories probably used for teaching. Additional documentation of Plan D can be found in the Smith College Archives.</p>
               <p>Institute for Child Guidance has a very small amount of descriptive material about the organization, and the proposal and notes for the final report of a study by Reynolds about adolescent girls in a Harlem school. Her letter of appointment to the institute is also included in this folder.</p>
               <p>The papers in the National Maritime Union section consist of minutes of some staff meetings, staff papers on policy matters, and some general descriptive material. A letter in the United Seaman's Service folder (Reynolds being their representative to the NMU) describes her work in detail.</p>
               <p>The seminar taught by Reynolds at the William Alanson White Institute in New York is described in a bulletin. There is also correspondence about her appointment and work at the institute.</p>
               <p>Speeches, Institutes, Seminars contains, in chronological order, texts or notes of most of the speeches given by Reynolds and some routine correspondence; there are also programs, reprints, session transcripts or notes, and correspondence for most of the institutes and seminars that Reynolds gave or participated in from 1929 to 1975 and a text that she used in a debate in 1919.</p>
