    <head>Biographical Note</head>
       <p>Mary Shannon Strudwick was born in Columbus, Ohio, 1908.   She graduated from the
Columbus School for Girls in 1926 and attended Smith College for two years before she left
to marry Austin Shannon, 1928. The two divorced in 1939 and she also had a short-lived
second marriage. After spending many years as a single woman, she married again in 1976 to
the actor  Sheppherd Strudwick, who died in 1983. Professionally, Mary Shannon Strudwick was
a self taught fashion designer and consultant.  She got started in the profession by helping
her first husband in his interior design business.  After moving to  New York City in 1939
she sold fashion ideas to stores.  Later, when she was living in La Luz and Sante Fe, New
Mexico, she designed store windows and displays.   After World War II she moved back to New
York, became an ad agency executive, and later worked for Macy's, Bonwit-Teller, and other
retailers.  As the founder and driving force behind "Mary Shannon, Inc.," which existed from
1949-1956, she consulted with industry leaders, most notably Cone Mills, on the styling and
promotion of textiles.  Strudwick also acted as a consultant for the American Craftsmen's
Council, Catalina, and Levi Strauss.  Her most notable achievement was her pioneering effort
to promote denim as "fashion."</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
       <p>The Mary Shannon Strudwick Papers consist of four volumes of scrapbooks and one volume of her self-published memoir, <title render="italic">Mary Telling</title>.  The scrapbooks, like the memoir, document the story of Strudwick's life from 1929-1994, and are artfully arranged.  Many photographs of Strudwick's family, her travel, and her design work, along with fabric samples, are interspersed within the text.  The collection could be a useful source for researchers interested in women's careers in business in the mid-20th century, the fashion industry, retailing,  advertising, and marketing.</p>
