<bioghist id="bioghist">
    
       <p>The National League of Women Voters was founded by victorious suffrage activists in 1920 to represent newly enfranchised women and "to foster education in citizenship and to support needed legislation."  The Northampton (Mass.) chapter was formed Sept 19, 1922.   In  keeping with the national organizaton's original mission,  Northampton  members publish a LWV Bulletin, write newspaper columns, produce radio programs, and publications aimed at increasing public awareness of  local political issues, government structure, voting rights and procedures.  In addition to their efforts in the arena of electoral politics, League members also work to raise citizens'  awareness about  local community issues such as schools, welfare, housing, city planning, taxes, garbage collection,  water  purification, and public health.</p>
