<bioghist id="bioghist">
       
     <p>Self-proclaimed "sex radical,"  Loraine Hutchins was born in Washington, DC, the daughter of
Thomas Jackson Hutchins and Adele Loraine Reese Hutchins.  She graduated from Montgomery Blair High
School in Silver Springs, Maryland in 1966.  She then went on to Shimer College, a small liberal
arts college then in Mount Carroll, Illinois, where she earned her BS in 1970.  According to <extref href="http://www.lorainehutchins.com/about/">Hutchins' Web site</extref>, "As a white teenager growing up in the suburbs of Washington DC, I learned that social justice and equality are all that really matter, and that
erotic justice, economic justice, and environmental justice are all connected.  But I could not
speak this insight aloud for many years."  After college, Hutchins spent several years working in
the DC-area, first for a juvenile justice agency and then in a series of fundraising or management
positions as a consultant.  Her work included fundraising for a Department of Education initiative,
"Hidden from History;" with a focus on US women's labor history, one of the documentaries produced
was "With Babies and Banners."</p>

<p>By 1990, Hutchins had come to find her true calling, as a leading advocate for the Bisexuality
Rights Movement.  In 1990, she co-founded BiNet USA, a national bisexual alliance, and served on
its Board of Directors for its first several years.  In 1991, she co-founded a local educational,
support and direct action group in DC, the Alliance of Multi-Cultural Bisexuals (AMBi). That same
year, Hutchins also co-edited, <title render="italic">Bi Any Other Name: Bisexual People Speak Out</title>,  a "groundbreaking
anthology [which] soon became a primer for the LGBT movement."  In 2001, she earned her PhD in
Cultural Studies at the Union Institute and University in Cincinnati; Hutchins disseration is
entitled, "Erotic Rites: A Cultural Analysis of Contemporary US Women's Sacred Sexuality Trends and
Traditions."  Since 2004 she has taught as an adjunct at two Maryland colleges, Towson University
and Montgomery College, where she serves as the Vice President of SEIU Local 500, a recently-formed
union for adjunct faculty.  Most of all, Hutchins has dedicated her life to making the connections
between sexuality and spirituality a reality.</p>

     <p>The papers include correspondence, photographs, research subject files, published and
unpublished writing by Hutchins and others, newspaper clippings, fliers, newsletters, and
periodicals.  The periodical collection is especially impressive, containing extensive runs of
radical feminist and feminist spirituality related periodicals and zines from the 1970s and
bisexuality-themed periodicals of the 1990s.  Other social justice movements--African American
civil rights, cooperative housing, anti-war, anti-nuclear--of the 1960s to the 1980s are also
represented.  Various aspects of sexualities (feminist/lesbian/bisexual) are covered as well. </p>
