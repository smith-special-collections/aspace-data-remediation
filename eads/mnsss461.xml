     <p>The Women at War Oral History Project was conceived and carried out by socioligist and oral historian, Revan Schendler, and playwright/director, John Hadden in 2006.  Its purpose was to give voice to women veterans from Western Massachusetts who had served in the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts. Schendler conducted oral histories with six women veterans, and she and Hadden wrote and produced a play based on the interviews called "Women at War: Bringing the Voices of Military Women to the Stage," which was performed at the Northampton (Mass.) Center for the Arts in 2006.</p>
