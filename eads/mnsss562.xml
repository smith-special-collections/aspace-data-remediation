     <p>The Roberta Cantow Papers are comprised of biographical information, personal writings, artwork, photographs, awards, and psychic readings (audio tapes), photographs, correspondence, email, publicity, and other documents pertaining to the production and distribution of Cantow's films, as well as Cantow's thoughts on issues and circumstances covered in the films. Audiovisual materials include original prints and copies in various formats (16mm film, video tape, DVDs, soundtrack, audio tapes, and audio CDs), of Cantow's films and performance pieces.  The films are documentary and include <title render="italic">Clotheslines</title>, "an homage to women and their daily work,...a lively and humorous look at the relationship that women have with the chore of cleaning the family clothes.... In this documentary, layers of emotions come to the surface as the commonality of women's work is exposed."  Other films include <title render="italic">Dr. Clown</title>, about Patch Adams, M.D.; <title render="italic">The Book of Laughs</title>, about the shared memories of two sisters; <title render="italic">If This Ain't Heaven</title>, the reminiscences of a fifty-year-old African American man; and <title render="italic">Illuminada</title>, a visual impression of Mexico.  There are smaller amounts of materials pertaining to other films and film possibilities that Cantow pursued, e.g. a script for T<title render="italic">The Revolt of the Mother</title>, based on the novel by Mary E. Wilkins Freeman.  There are also recorded interviews by Cantow of herbalist, Susan Weed, and  Goddess scholar, Karen Tate.</p>
