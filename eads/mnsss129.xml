         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Susan B. Anthony was born 15 February 1820 in Adams,
    Massachusetts. She was the second of seven children of Lucy
    Reed and Daniel Anthony. Her father was from a Quaker
    background and believed in the equal education of his
    daughters and his sons. His successful cotton manufacturing
    business prompted a family move to Battenville, New York in
    the summer of 1826. In the summer of 1835, Anthony obtained
    her first teaching position, and in 1839, she moved to
    Hardscrabble, New York, and continued to support herself
    through teaching. In November of 1845, she settled in
    Rochester, New York, which she considered home until her
    dying day. From 1846 to 1849 she was the headmistress of the
    female department at Canajoharie Academy in Rochester, New
    York.</p>
         <p>Susan B. Anthony's name is synonymous with women's rights
    and the suffrage movement, but her activism began with
    participation in the Temperance and Abolitionist movements of
    the mid-nineteenth century. In 1848, Anthony joined the
    Daughters of Temperance, then founded the Woman's New York
    State Temperance Society in 1852. By 1856, Anthony was
    William Lloyd Garrison's primary representative in New York
    for the American Anti-slavery Society.</p>

<daodesc><p>Susan Brownell Anthony at age 36, 1856</p></daodesc></dao> 
         <p>It is without a doubt that Susan B. Anthony was most
    passionate about the cause of women's rights. Securing the
    right to vote for women became her life's work. In 1848, Jane
    Hunt, Mary Ann McClintock, Lucretia Mott, Elizabeth Cady
    Stanton, and Martha Coffin Wright organized a women's rights
    convention in Seneca Falls, New York. Although her father was
    there, Susan B. Anthony did not attend this historic event.
    She met Stanton in 1850, and they became lifelong friends and
    partners in the endeavor to guarantee women's rights. Both
    women maintained a very high-profile as leaders of the
    suffrage movement. In 1854, Anthony organized the first
    Women's Rights Society in New York State. In this same year,
    she collected signatures successfully petitioning the New
    York State legislature for an extension of the Married
    Women's Property Act, which was granted in 1860. In 1866, she
    collected signatures petitioning the U.S. Congress for
    women's suffrage.</p>
         <p>Anthony and Stanton both maintained their commitment to
    the abolitionist cause as they increased their activity in
    women's rights organizing. In 1863, they formed the Women's
    National Loyal League, which demanded the abolition of
    slavery by constitutional amendment. However, at the end of
    the Civil War, their opposition to the Fourteenth and
    Fifteenth amendments, which guaranteed black male suffrage
    but excluded women, caused the loss of some strong
    abolitionist allies. Opposition to Anthony and Stanton's
    controversial position, as well as to their methods of
    achieving the vote, caused a twenty year schism in the
    women's suffrage movement. The result was two separate
    suffrage associations, which maintained similar goals but
    employed very different strategies. Lucy Stone founded the
    American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA), which supported
    the Fifteenth Amendment and continued to allow men's
    participation in the Association. The AWSA attempted to avoid
    all "irrelevant issues" that might alienate support for their
    cause. They focused on the suffrage question and sought the
    ballot on a state-by-state basis. In 1869, Anthony and
    Stanton founded the National Women's Suffrage Association
    (NWSA). It was to be a "women only" organization and Stanton
    was elected the President while Anthony served as the Vice
    President.</p>
         <p>Unlike the AWSA, the NWSA was not afraid to create
    controversy or draw attention. Its primary goal was to
    guarantee a woman's right to vote in the form of a national
    constitutional amendment. They acknowledged women's rights as
    encompassing other women's issues such as birth control,
    divorce law reform, and prostitution. They advocated for the
    organization of working women, criticized the subordinate
    role of women fostered by the church, took up a critical
    discussion regarding the societal double-standard, and
    addressed the issue of discrimination in employment and pay.
    NWSA publicly supported the notorious Victoria Woodhull,
    whose disregard for convention and eccentric behavior
    outraged many people. Association with such an extremist
    brought a fair amount of criticism to the NWSA.</p>
         <p>NWSA also used relatively radical methods for achieving
    its objectives. Public protest and "overt actions" were
    staged by its members on a regular basis. Anthony was
    directly involved in many controversial actions taken by
    NWSA. In 1872, Anthony was arrested, convicted, and fined for
    illegally voting in the Presidential election. On 4 July
    1876, she staged a suffrage protest at the Centennial
    Celebration being held in Liberty Square, Philadelphia.
    Anthony was constantly at the front lines in the battle for
    woman suffrage. She toured the country giving speeches and
    passionately rallying support for her cause. By 1890, the
    tensions that caused the division within the suffrage
    movement had eased, and the AWSA and the NWSA reconciled.
    They merged to form one organization called the National
    American Women's Suffrage Association (NAWSA). Susan B.
    Anthony served as president of NAWSA from 1892-1900. She
    continued to organize and lead the national grassroots
    movement. She extended her work further by contributing her
    knowledge and effort to the International Women's Suffrage
    Movement. She traveled to Berlin, Germany in 1904 to help
    found the International Woman Suffrage Alliance. Anthony
    participated in the successful campaign to open the
    University of Rochester to women (1900). From 1881-1902, she
    initiated and published the first four volumes of History of
    Women's Suffrage.</p>
         <p>Susan B. Anthony died 13 March 1906 in Rochester, New
    York. She was eighty-six years old and had devoted over half
    of her lifetime to the women's suffrage movement. On 26
    August, 1920 the Nineteenth Amendment was ratified. This
    federal legislation secured women's right to vote in every
    state in the country, and it was referred to by some as the
    Susan B. Anthony Amendment. In recognition of her incredible
    contribution to the woman suffrage movement, various states
    have declared 26 August or 15 February---her birthday---as
    Susan B. Anthony Day.</p>

         <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
         <p>The Susan B. Anthony Papers consist of .75 linear feet of
    material. They contain primarily miscellaneous information
    regarding her professional achievements and the efforts by
    others to memorialize her work (1894-1970). Series I contains
    Biographical Material and Writings. This is the most
    extensive series, and it includes a wide range of
    miscellaneous items.</p>
         <p>There are various copies of clippings (1876-1979), which
    provide information about her involvement and contribution to
    the women's rights movement. Postcards, an original portrait
    painted by her nephew (1907), and some original photographs
    (1875-1906) (as well as numerous copies of photographs
    (1850-1906)) documenting Anthony from youth to old age are
    also included.</p>
         <p>Also found in Series I is a good deal of material
    regarding the efforts by others to memorialize Anthony.
    Included are: clippings concerning her birthplace at Adams,
    Massachusetts (1927-70); and clippings, photographs, and
    printed matter regarding the memorial in her Rochester, New
    York home (1948). There are also various original
    commemorative postage stamps, as well as extensive
    correspondence, clippings, memorabilia, news releases, and
    photographs of the First Day Women Suffrage Stamp ceremony in
    Adams, Massachusetts (26 August, 1970). The stamp was issued
    to commemorate the 50 year anniversary of the ratification of
    the Nineteenth Amendment. The League of Women Voters
    initiated this event and organized this celebration, choosing
    Adams, Massachusetts because it was Anthony's birthplace.
    This material documents the detailed process undertaken to
    bring such an event to fruition.</p>
         <p>There is other material describing assorted Anthony
    memorials across the United States, including information
    regarding her entry in to the New York University Hall of
    Fame (1950), Smithsonian Institution (1920-41), Susan B.
    Anthony memorial libraries (1941-50), Susan B. Anthony Day
    (1939-7), the Tree Project (1938), and other miscellaneous
    memorial efforts (1940-71).</p>
         <p>Documents of Edwin T. Marsh, inspector of polls, detailing
    his arrest for permitting Anthony to register to vote (1872),
    provide insight into the illegal voting scandal for which
    Anthony was also arrested.</p>
         <p>Series II consists of a limited amount of assorted
    personal and professional correspondence. There are some
    typed copies of letters to family and friends (1872-1905), as
    well as typed copies of third party correspondence by those
    who knew Anthony (1894-1944). A collection of original
    autographs and a few handwritten letters finish this
    series.</p>
