<p>The International Institute for Girls in Spain evolved out of a school founded by a Protestant missionary in Santander, Spain, in 1877. The Institute was incorporated in Massachusetts in 1892 as a non-denominational Christian organization "for the purpose of establishing and maintaining an institution for the education of girls in Spain."</p>
<p>The following is a brief outline of the major events in the history of the IIGS. A published history of the early years of the Institute, Misioneras, feministas, educadoras: Historia del Instituto Internacional by Carmen de Zulueta (Madrid: Editorial Castalia, 1984), is available in the archives reading room. Short histories of the Institute in English and Spanish can be found within the records in Series IV - Historical Materials and Memorabilia, and in Series XI - Publications.</p>

<chronitem>
<date>1871</date>
<event>Alice Gordon Gulick and her husband William go to Spain to establish a Protestant mission under the auspices of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM).  They settle in Santander.</event>

</chronitem>
<chronitem>
<date>1877</date>
<event>Alice Gordon Gulick founds a boarding school with the aim of training young Spanish women to become teachers in Protestant mission schools. The school consists of 5 pupils. The Women's Board of Missions (WBM) of the ABCFM agrees to support the school and help provide teachers.</event>
</chronitem>
<chronitem>
<date>1881</date>
<event>The Gulicks move the school to San Sebastian where it is known as the Colegio Norteamericano. Alice Gordon Gulick starts a series of appeals for outside funds to establish a women's college in Spain along the lines of her alma mater, Mt. Holyoke.</event>
</chronitem>
<chronitem>
<date>1888</date>
<event>Two teachers establish a school library 'to cultivate a taste for books' among the students.</event>
</chronitem>
<chronitem>
<date>1890</date>
<event>Some students in the school begin training for university level study by preparing to pass the state exam for a secondary degree (bachillerato).</event>
</chronitem>
<chronitem> <date>1892</date> <event>To secure legal right to own property and conduct a school, the International Institute for Girls in Spain is incorporated in Massachusetts. </event></chronitem>

<chronitem> <date>1898-1903</date> <event>The International Institute moves across the French border to Biarritz during the Spanish-American War. </event></chronitem>

<chronitem> <date>1902</date> <event>The IIGS Corporation purchases a house in Madrid (at Fortuny 53) to establish the school on a permanent basis where it can collaborate more closely with Spanish educational reformers. </event></chronitem>

<chronitem> <date>1903</date> <event>The Institute moves to Madrid. Alice Gordon Gullck dies on September 24. The International Institute League is formed in the U.S. as an adjunct to the Corporation to continue Mrs. Gulick-'s fund-raising efforts. The Corporation and the WBM divide the school into two departments supported and administered separately. The WBM funds the Normal Department for Spanish Girls which provides the first three years of training and continues the work of the evangelical school. The Corporation provides the last three years of training in the Collegiate Department preparing its students for university-level study. A permanent fund is established for the library which is given its own room. </event></chronitem>

<chronitem> <date>1904</date> <event>Work is begun on a building at Miguel Angel 8 to be known as Alice Gordon Gulick Memorial Hall. The Institute establishes a course to prepare students to study music in a conservatory. The Institute inaugurates a series of lectures by leading intellectuals. </event></chronitem>

<chronitem> <date>1906</date> <event>The two departments are separated into two distinct schools. The evangelical school becomes the Colegio Internacional para Senoritas with Anna F. Webb as director and WBM funding. The university preparatory school is known as the llGS with Bertha C. Bidwell as director and funding from the IIGS Corporation and the International Institute League. William H. Gulick serves as rector for both schools. </event></chronitem>

<chronitem> <date>1910</date> <event>Alice Gordon Gulick Memorial Hall is completed: The Colegio Internacional para Senoritas moves to Barcelona. Susan Huntington is appointed Director of the IIGS. </event></chronitem>

<chronitem> <date>1916</date> <event>The Junta para Ampliacion de Estudios e Investigaciones Cientificas (Board for the Promotion of Historical Research and Scientific Investigation), a group established by the state to promote education, presents the Corporation with a proposal for collaboration. </event></chronitem>

<chronitem> <date>1917</date> <event>As a war measure, the IIGS agrees to collaborate with the Junta as a 3-year experiment.  The two IIGS buildings (Fortuny 53 and Miguel Angel 8) are leased to the Junta for the use of the Residencia de Senoritas (a residence and center for women university students) and the Instituto-Escuela (a co-educational elementary and secondary school founded as an experiment in modern educational methods). The IIGS supplies "a few," American instructors to teach English, physical education, and science. These instructors, paid by the Corporation, are to "continue the American influence," participate in academic policy making, run the library, and provide instruction in areas where it is otherwise unavailable in Spain. The IICS ceases to function as an autonomous entity. </event></chronitem>

<chronitem> <date>1920</date> <event>The University of Madrid agrees to give credit for laboratory work successfully completed at the Institute under the supervision of the American instructors. Labs are set up at the IIGS because the University has no lab space for women. </event></chronitem>

<chronitem> <date>1924</date> <event>As part of the collaboration, the libraries of the Residencia de Senoritas and IIGS are merged. </event></chronitem>

<chronitem> <date>1925</date> <event>The International Institute League (formed 1903) disbands. </event></chronitem>

<chronitem> <date>1927</date> <event>The building at Fortuny 53 is sold to the Junta for the use of the Residencia.  A condition of the sale is that the building be used for the education of women.  Library science courses are established at the Institute. </event></chronitem>

<chronitem> <date>1928</date> <event>The Instituto-Escuela moves to its own building leaving Miguel Angel 8 to the IIGS. Institute staff continues to collaborate with the Residencia teaching classes in English and library science. </event></chronitem>

<chronitem> <date>1930</date> <event>The IIGS agrees to rent space to Smith College's newly established junior year in Spain program. </event></chronitem>

<chronitem> <date>1936-39</date> <event>The IIGS and the Residencia shut down during the Spanish Civil War. </event></chronitem>

<chronitem> <date>1939-44</date> <event>World War II. Miguel Angel 8 is under the care of the U.S. Embassy. The library of the IIGS remains open and the librarians continue to teach English and library science on a small scale. There is no American staff in Madrid. Though Mary Sweeney is the board-appointed Director, Enriqueta Martin acts as the Corporation's representative in Spain. The Corporation uses its funds to subsidize schools in France and Mexico for Spanish refugee children under the auspices of the American Friends Service Committee. </event></chronitem>

<chronitem> <date>1944-50</date> <event>Afraid of losing the building and unwilling to continue to cooperate with the Franco government, the IIGS rents Miguel Angel 8 to the U.S. Embassy for the storage of Embassy documents. The embassy offers to repair the building and provide space elsewhere in Madrid for the re-establishment of IIGS programs. </event></chronitem>

<chronitem> <date>1946</date> <event>The IIGS establishes its Foreign Scholars Program. Under this program the IIGS sponsors or helps to sponsor study in the U.S. and England for some of its most advanced students. </event></chronitem>

<chronitem> <date>1947</date> <event>Americans resume teaching English through the Institute. </event></chronitem>

<chronitem> <date>1950</date> <event>The IIGS moves back into Miguel Angel 8 and agrees to share the building with Colegio-Estudio, a private school established along the lines of the Instituto-Escuela. The IIGS administers its own programs in English and library science, provides English teachers for Colegio-Estudio, sponsors concerts, lectures, English-speaking teas, and exhibits, and rents space to other educational programs. A group of graduates of the library science program forms the Asociacion de Diplomados del Instituto Internacional (alumnae association). The children's library is established as a separate entity in order to serve Colegio-Estuaio's students and subsequently the general community. </event></chronitem>

<chronitem> <date>1950s and 1960s</date> <event>The IIGS explores a variety of programs and activities of its own while renting space to various junior year abroad and graduate study programs from American colleges and universities. </event></chronitem>

<chronitem> <date>1951</date> <event>The Institute establishes extension courses in library science in other cities in Spain. </event></chronitem>

<chronitem> <date>1952</date> <event>The English Program is reorganized into two courses, one concentrating on the study of the English language and American civilization and literature, the other providing training in teaching English as a second language. </event></chronitem>

<chronitem> <date>1967</date> <event>Colegio-Estudio moves to its own building but retains offices in Miguel Angel 8. </event></chronitem>

<chronitem> <date>1968</date> <event>A development plan is prepared and foundation support is sought for an expansion of IIGS programs. The effort is, for the most part, unsuccessful. </event></chronitem>

<chronitem> <date>1971- </date> <event>The Institute begins litigation to reclaim Fortuny 53 which is no longer being used for the education of women (a condition of the sale of the building in 1927). </event></chronitem>

<chronitem> <date>1979</date> <event>Faced with financial and legal problems, the Institute reduces its activities. The library science program is taken over by Spanish universities, the University of Southern California assumes administration of the English Program, and the Psychology program is reduced to a few courses. </event></chronitem>

<chronitem> <date>1980</date> <event>The Corporation votes to cease operations in Madrid as of June 30, 1981. This decision is never carried out. </event></chronitem>

<chronitem> <date>1985</date> <event>The University of Southern California English Program closes. The IIGS votes to re-establish its own English program. The Freshman Year Program is established to prepare Spanish students to transfer to American colleges and universities to study for an undergraduate degree. </event></chronitem>

<p>
The records of the International Institute for Girls in Spain consist of 24 linear feet of correspondence, memorabilia, minutes, reports, photographs, publications, and other papers (in English and Spanish) relating to the history and activities of the IIGS and its cooperation with other educational organizations in Spain and the U.S. The records are a rich source for the study of educational reform and women's education in Spain, Spanish-U.S. cooperation, and the experience of Protestant missionaries in Catholic Spain.
</p>
<p>In the early 1970s the Corporation assigned the task of organizing the bulk of the records to retired IIGS librarian Enriqueta Martin. Left unfinished, Miss Martin's arrangement was disordered when the records were moved in the late 1970s. Her work survives in two forms: an annotated card file (Series VII - Lists) and notes attached to individual items within the records. These notes (in Spanish) describe, comment on, or refute the contents of each item and have been left in place as part of the record.</p>
<p>The bulk of the material consists of files maintained in this country in the Boston office of the Corporation and by long-time Corresponding Secretary Mary Sweeney. Evidence contained in the records indicates that most of the early records produced and maintained in Spain were lost or destroyed during the Spanish Civil War. However, records kept in this country such as reports and published correspondence by founders Alice Gordon Gulick and William Hooker Gulick, and early directors such as Susan Huntington give insight into the early activities and progress of the school. The work of the Institute is best documented starting in 1950 due to the extensive records kept by Corresponding Secretary Mary Sweeney.</p>
<p>Surviving records produced and maintained in Spain consist of correspondence files of the director (Series II), library records (Series VI), personnel files (Series IX), photographs (Series X), memorabilia (Series IV), and student papers (Series XIV). These records are most complete for the period between 1950 and the late 1970s.</p>
<p>The records are divided into fifteen series: Academic Programs; Correspondence; Financial; Historical Materials and Memorabilia; Legal; Library; Lists; Minutes, Agendas, and Calls to Meetings; Personnel; Photographs; Publications; Reports; Speeches; Student Papers; and Affiliated Organizations and Programs.</p>

<unittitle>Series II. CORRESPONDENCE</unittitle>
</did>
<scopecontent>
<p>This series is divided into seven subseries, Boston
 Secretary, Clerk, Corresponding Secretary, Director,
 President, Treasurer, and General.</p>
<p>Boston Secretary consists of the correspondence files
 of the Corporation's secretary in Boston, Mass. The
 material is primarily corporation membership
 record-keeping and is divided into six sections: Clerk,
 Corresponding Secretary, Director, President, Treasurer,
 and General. Correspondence with all individuals other
 than those holding positions in the first five sections
 is filed in the last section, General.</p>
<p>Correspondence files of the Clerk of the Corporation
 appear in the second subseries filed chronologically. The
 bulk of the material pertains to Corporation activities
 in the U.S.</p>
<p>The Corresponding Secretary (now known as "Executive
 Secretary") is the Corporation's main link with the staff
 in Spain. The correspondence contains ongoing reporting
 of the activities of the Institute in Madrid, extensive
 material on the selection of staff and scholarship
 students, and on arrangements for IIGS foreign scholars'
 study in the U.S. The files are divided into seven
 sections: Boston Secretary, Clerk, Director, Liaison
 Committee, President, Treasurer, and General. As with the
 Boston Secretary's files above, the 'General' section
 consists of correspondence with all individuals not
 covered in the preceding sections. The Liaison Committee
 section contains correspondence to members of the
 committee which assumed the duties of the-Corresponding
 Secretary for four years after the retirement of Mary
 Sweeney in January 1964.</p>
<p>The files in the fourth subseries reflect the
 Director's duties as head of the educational and service
 staff at the Institute and as the Corporation's
 representative in dealings with the Spanish government
 and the educational community in Madrid. The files also
 show the Director's participation in the selection of
 staff and scholarship recipients and her/his
 responsibility for the maintenance of IIGS
 building(s).</p>
<p>The subseries is divided into six sections: Clerk,
 Corresponding Secretary, President, Representative in
 Spain, Treasurer, and General. The section
 "Representative in Spain" contains correspondence with
 Enriqueta Martin who acted on the Corporation's behalf in
 Spain during World War II while Institute activities were
 curtailed. Mary Sweeney was the director appointed by the
 Corporation during this period but she remained in the
 U.S. and Enriqueta Martin represented the Institute in a
 semi-official capacity.</p>
<p>The fifth and sixth subseries contain the files of the
 President and the Treasurer of the Corporation each filed
 chronologically. The President's files contain letters
 written of behalf of the Corporation and the Treasurer's
 files are principally about Institute and Corporation
 finances.</p>
<p>The seventh subseries, General, is divided into four
 sections. The first, 'Miscellaneous' consists of
 correspondence of staff members and Corporators of the
 IIGS who are not in one of the six major positions in the
 first five subseries. The second section, 'Ilene Avery',
 consists of personal correspondence of one of the
 Institute's directors which reflects her involvement in
 the educational community in the U.S. and Spain, but is
 not directly related to Institute business. The third
 section is the correspondence of 'Enriqueta Martin',
 long-time librarian of the Institute and director of the
 Library Science Program. Her correspondence has been
 separated from the bulk of the general correspondence
 because of her long service and intense involvement with
 the Institute. The fourth section is the correspondence
 of 'Mary Sweeney' from the period immediately following
 her retirement as Corresponding Secretary on January 1,
 1964. This correspondence has been isolated because she
 continued to perform many of the duties of the
 Corresponding Secretary while not actually holding the
 post.</p>
