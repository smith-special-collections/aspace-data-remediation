	International organization. Records of officers, Board of Trustees and directors, and annual meetings make up approximately half of the collection. Correspondence and memoranda are extensive.

	<p>	Originally called the Virginia Gildersleeve International Fund for University Women, the Virginia Gildersleeve Inernational Fund (VGIF) was founded in 1969 by a group of women affiliated with the International Federation of University Women.  They sought to create a fund to provide monies for projects "which further the development of educational theory and practice, foster the development of human resources, and advance the cause of mutual understanding and cooperation among university women throughout the world," particularly in developing nations.  The incorporators named the fund for Virginia Gildersleeve, Dean of Barnard College from 1911 to 1947, in honor of her commitment to the concept that women college graduates could, given the resources, make significant contributions to the development of their countries and to the world at large. To this end, the organization regularly underwrites conferences, workshops, and educational projects undertaken by individuals and organizations all over the world.  Funded projects typically included conferences on international women's issues, small-scale economic schemes, micro-credit loans, educational activities, environmental endeavors, sex education and HIV-related projects.  In 1997, the VGIF achieved NGO status at the United Nations.</p>

	<p>For a comprehensive history of the Virginia Gildersleeve International Fund, please see <title render="italic">History: 1968-1978</title>, by former president Althea K. Hottel in SERIES I:  ADMINISTRATION.</p>

    <scopecontent id="scope">
	
	<p>	The Virginia Gildersleeve International Fund Records consist of 32.5 linear feet of materials dating from 1969 to 2011.  Because VGIF officers have requested that additions to the records be processed periodically, the container list consists of three parts.  Though there is some overlap of dates in all three parts, materials in Part I (8.5 linear feet) document the years 1969 to 1996, the bulk of the materials in Part II (9.5 linear feet) cover the years 1993 to 2001, and Part III (14.5 linear feet) primarily documents the years 2000 to 2011.  More records will be added when they are no longer in current use by the organization.  Parts I, II and III are each arranged in three series:</p>

   <list>
	<item><title render="bold">I.  ADMINISTRATION</title></item>
	
	<item><title render="bold">II.  COMMITTEES</title></item>

	<item><title render="bold">III.  AUDIOVISUAL MATERIALS AND COMPUTER MEDIA</title></item>
   </list>

	<p>Approximately one third of the collection is comprised of files of the Officers, the Board of Trustees/Directors, and the Annual Meetings of the general membership.  The administrative files are for the most part complete and span the organization's entire history, with some exceptions:  the records of the Secretary cover only 1972 to 1978 and 1993 to 1996, and the years 1985 and 1986 are missing from the files of the Board of Directors/Trustees.  The correspondence and memoranda are extensive, and reveal much about the workings of the Officers and the Board with regard to the purpose and function of the organization. </p> 

	<p>The rest of the collection consists of the files of various committees, particularly those of the Project Grants Committee, whose members screen grant applications and recommend, semi-annually, the most promising ones to the Board of Trustees/Directors for funding.  Records of VGIF sponsorship of the International Federation of University Women and of the Asian Women's Institute are particularly strong, and other project grants are also well documented. For a concise overview of the history of VGIF (UW) committees, see "Final Report of VGIF Task Force on Organizational Structure, 2007" in Box 57, Folder 16. </p>

	<scopecontent>
		<p>This series contains general administrative records and those of the President, Secretary, Treasurer, Board of Trustees/Directors, and the Annual Meetings of the general members.  Material pertaining to general administration is arranged alphabetically, and other records are listed in the order given above.  Types of material include correspondence and memoranda, agendas and minutes, reports, financial information, proxies and ballots, and brochures and newsletters.  In keeping with the original order of the records, the President's files are arranged by topic.  Records of Annual Meetings consist mainly of agendas, minutes, and reports; additional materials pertaining to the meetings can also be found in the officers' records and in <title render="bold">SERIES II.  COMMITTEES</title>.  The Board of Trustees/Directors met annually in April from 1970 until sometime between 1984 and 1987, after which they met semi-annually in April and October or November.  Records of the meetings of the Board are arranged chronologically.</p>
		<p>This series is comprised of three parts. Part I spans 1969-1994 and measures 4.5 linear feet. Part II spans 1972-2003, with the bulk of materials between 1993-2001, and measures 5 linear feet. Part III spans 1960-2011, with the bulk of materials between 2000-2011, and measures 3.5 linear feet.</p>

	<scopecontent>
		<p>This series consists of the records of the various committees formed as necessary to attend to specific VGIF business.  Types of material include correspondence, memoranda, photographs, and reports. The committees are listed alphabetically, with the exception of the Project Grants Committee, which, due to the volume of material it generates, is listed last. Researchers may also wish to cross-reference material in this series with the records of the Officers and the Board of Trustees/Directors in <title render="bold">SERIES I.  ADMINISTRATION</title>.</p>

	<p>Project Grants Committee material is comprised of general committee records and files on project proposals submitted for possible funding. Correspondence pertaining to a specific project is filed with that project; general correspondence and memoranda in which the project is mentioned along with other business may be found in the general correspondence of the Project Grants Committee. Grant files are arranged alphabetically by continent and subsequently by country in Parts I and II.  Because VGIF significantly expanded the number of grants it awarded early in the 21st century, grant files in Part III are arranged by the year in which the grants were initially funded.  In 1989, VGIF began assigning numbers to proposals; thus, grants from 1989 onward are filed by grant number.  VGIF numbered all project proposals, but only retained files on projects that were funded, so the numbers that appear here are not sequential.</p>

	<p>Project Grant files typically include the application, correspondence, mid-year and final reports, sometimes a site visit report, sometimes photos, and on occasion promotional materials from the organization such as posters and flyers.  Note that information on the International Federation of University Women (IFUW) can be found both in Project Grant files and in the administrative files, as VGIF both funded and participated in the triennial conference.   </p>

	<p>Project grant files also document concerns about fraudulent projects (see Project #1683, #1850, #2056, #2130, #2514, #2556, #2854, and #3124), whether projects benefitted men more than women (see Project #1992 and Project #2056) and policies relating to subsequent funding of successful projects (see Project #1992 and Project #2417).</p>

<p>Note on names: The Constitution and Bylaws Committee changed its name to the Governance Committee in the 2000s. After April 2008, the On-Site Visit Program became known as the Funded Grants Evaluation Committee. 
</p>
	<p>This series is comprised of three parts. Part I spans 1970-1996 and measures 4 linear feet. Part II spans 1984-2002 and measures 4.5 linear feet. Part III spans 1973-2011, with the bulk of materials between 1999-2009, and measures 10 linear feet.</p>
