	<p>Alison Bechdel was born in Lock Haven, Pennsylvania to Bruce Allen Bechdel--high school English teacher, antiques dealer, and funeral director--and Helen Fontana Bechdel--high school English teacher and amateur actress. Her family also owned and operated a funeral home, dubbed the Fun Home by Bechdel and her two brothers.</p>

<p>Bechdel earned her A.A. in 1979 from Simon's Rock Early College (now Simon's Rock of Bard College) and her B.A. from Oberlin College in 1981. She applied to many art schools but was rejected. She worked in various publishing industry office jobs in New York City from 1981 to 1985, and as a production writer for Equal Time in Minneapolis, MN from 1986 to 1990.  According to the autobiographical <title render="italic">The Indelible Alison Bechdel</title>, she began "Dykes to Watch Out For" (DTWOF) as a single drawing labeled: "Marianne, dissatisfied with the morning brew: Dykes to Watch Out For, plate no. 27." An acquaintance recommended she send her work to <title render="italic">Womannews </title>newspaper, which began publishing the strip regularly beginning with the July-August 1983 issue. After a year, other outlets began running the strip, and it was syndicated in 1985.</p> 

<p>In 1988, Bechdel began a short-lived, page-length strip about the staff of a queer newspaper, titled <title render="italic">Servants to the Cause</title>, for <title render="italic">The Advocate</title> newspaper. The success of DTWOF allowed Bechdel to quit her day job in 1990 to work on the strip full-time. Bechdel has written and drawn autobiographical strips, has done illustrations for magazines and websites, and has written numerous books, including <title render="italic">Dykes to Watch Out For</title> (1986), <title render="italic">More Dykes to Watch Out For</title> (1988),<title render="italic"> New Improved! Dykes to Watch Out For</title> (1990), <title render="italic">Unnatural Dykes to Watch Out For</title> (1995), <title render="italic">Hot, Throbbing Dykes to Watch Out For</title> (1997), <title render="italic">The Indelible Alison Bechdel: Confessions, Comix and Miscellaneous Dykes to Watch Out For</title> (1998), <title render="italic">Dykes and Sundry Other Carbon-based Life-Forms to Watch Out For</title> (2003), <title render="italic">Invasion of the Dykes to Watch Out For</title> (2005), <title render="italic">Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic</title> (2006), and <title render="italic">The Essential Dykes to Watch Out For</title> (2008). Four of Bechdel's books have won Lamba Literary Awards for humor, and <title render="italic">The Indelible Alison Bechdel</title> won a Lambda Literary Award in the biography/autobiography category. In February 2004, Bechdel married her partner since 1992, Amy Rubin, in a civil ceremony in San Francisco; they separated in 2006.</p>
