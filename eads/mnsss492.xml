          <head>Historical Note</head>
        <p>Cosmopolitan Associates, Inc., an organization of World War II war brides, was founded in
   1950 by Enid Kathleen Brazil Wood and Judy Bond Ward, both Englishwomen who had married American
   servicemen.  The purpose of the organization was to charter airline flights to Europe so war
   brides living in the U.S. could visit their families overseas, at a time when flying on
   commercial airlines was prohibitively expensive and private parties were not permitted to
   charter flights. Wood served as President for more than 30 years, and Bond as Vice-President,
   and the two were assisted by a dedicated team of national officers.  Cosmopolitan Associates
   evolved over 25 years to include many other ways of supporting war brides, with 6,000 members in
   90 chapters across the U.S.   The organization is still in existence, however its mission has
   changed over the years to be more of a social club operating out of New Jersey. Membership now
   includes immigrant women in the U.S.</p>

   <p>In her youth, Enid Wood was a champion swimmer.  She married Charles C. Wood with who she had two
   sons, Glenn and Keith.  Enid Wood left Cosmopolitan Associates in 1978 to start her own travel
   business, Enid's Travel Desk. in the 1970s.</p>
