       <p>Helen Hiett was born in Chenoa, Illinois, 1913.  After graduating from the University of Chicago in 1934, she lived in Europe where she studied at the League of Nations in Geneva and edited a monthly review for the Graduate Institute of International Affairs.  In 1937 she lived in a girls' labor camp in Germany, studying Nazi indoctrination methods.  She was a foreign correspondent for NBC during World War II in France, Spain and Gibraltar, the first outsider to broadcast from the Spanish Civil War.  She continued her career as a foreign correspondent for NBC after returning to the U.S., from 1941 to 1944; and was a war correspondent from 1944 to 1945 in Italy, Germany and Austria.
