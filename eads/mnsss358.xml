<p>The Ames Family Papers span six generations and include two separate families with the surname "Ames," which came together in 1900 with the marriage of Blanche Ames and Oakes Ames.  The Butler family is also represented to some extent, notably by Civil War general Benjamin Franklin Butler and his wife, Sarah Hildreth Butler.  The following biographical sketches pertain to some, but not all, of the individuals whose papers are in the collection, beginning with Oakes Ames in Generation II and ending with George A. Plimpton in Generation VI.  Additional information is located in SERIES I. FAMILY HISTORY, and in the Appendix.  This section does not include information about family members whose papers are extremely small in volume, except, in a few cases, to provide context and to clarify familial and generational relationships.  Detailed biographies of some individuals may be found in American National Biography, the Dictionary of American Biography, and Notable American Women.</p>

<p><title render="bold">Generation II</title></p>

<p><title render="underline">Oakes Ames</title></p>

<p>Oakes Ames, the elder son of Oliver Ames and Susanna Angier Ames, was born on January 10, 1804 in Easton, Massachusetts.  He was married to Evelina Gilmore, with whom he had four children: Oakes, Oliver III, Frank, and Susan.  At an early age he entered into his father's business, Ames Shovel Works, management of which he and his brother, also named Oliver, took over in 1844.  The discovery of gold in California in 1849 led to the profitable expansion of the company, which by then had been renamed Ames and Sons.  During the Civil War, Oakes Ames was urged to run for government office and in 1862 won a seat in the U.S. Congress, where he served for ten years.  He was involved in the building of the Transcontinental Railroad, and in the attendant congressional Credit Mobilier stock scandals of 1872-1873.  Oakes Ames died on May 8, 1873.</p>

<p><title render="underline">Oliver Ames</title></p>

<p>Oliver Ames was born on November 5, 1807 in North Easton, Massachusetts, the second son of Susanna Angier Ames and Oliver Ames.  He attended local schools and, after briefly working in a law office, joined his father and brother, Oakes, in the Ames Shovel Works (later renamed Ames and Sons).  In 1833 he married Sarah Lothrop, with whom he had two children, Frederick and Helen.  The shovel company thrived under the brothers' management and by 1860 was valued at $4 million. Oliver Ames was instrumental in the building of the Transcontinental Railroad; however, unlike his brother, he was not implicated in the Credit Mobilier scandals.  After the rail line was completed, he served as President of the Union Pacific Railroad from 1866 to 1869; he remained a director until his death.  After leaving the Union Pacific presidency, he turned his full attention to the shovel company, which was facing bankruptcy at the time, and returned it to profitability.  He was director of a number of railways other than Union Pacific, and also of several banks in Boston and in North Easton. He was a vice president of the Massachusetts Total Abstinence Society and a member of the Unitarian Church.  Oliver Ames died on March 9, 1877. </p> 

<p><title render="underline">Benjamin F. Butler and Sarah Hildreth Butler</title></p>

<p>Benjamin Franklin Butler was born in Nottingham, New Hampshire on November 5, 1818, the son of Charlotte Ellison and John Butler.  Having failed to gain admission to West Point, he attended Waterville College (now Colby College), graduating in 1840.  He studied law for two years and was admitted to the Massachusetts Bar in 1842.  Butler served one term as state representative in 1853 and one term as state senator in 1858.  His involvement in politics led to a generalship in the Civil War, despite a lack of military training and experience.  He served as controversial military governor of New Orleans and, after the war, as Congressman from Massachusetts (1867 to 1875).  Butler, a staunch Reconstructionist, supported the first Civil Rights Act as well as efforts to curtail the activities of the Ku Klux Klan.  In 1882 he won the governorship of Massachusetts and in 1884 he ran unsuccessfully for President.  Benjamin F. Butler died in Washington, D.C. on January 11, 1893.</p>

<p>Sarah Hildreth was born on August 17, 1816 in Dracut, Massachusetts, the daughter of Dolly Jones and Israel Hildreth.  Having shown considerable talent in dramatics, she was sent to Boston at the age of sixteen for formal training, after which she acted to great acclaim in Boston, New York, Charleston, South Carolina, and Cincinnati, Ohio.  She gave up her stage career after marrying Benjamin F. Butler in 1844.  The couple had four children, three of whom survived to adulthood:  Blanche, Paul, and Benjamin (aka Ben-Israel).  Sarah Hildreth Butler died on April 8, 1876.</p>

<p><title render="bold">Generation III</title></p>

<p><title render="underline">Adelbert Ames and Blanche Butler Ames</title></p>

<p>Adelbert Ames was born in Rockland, Maine on October 31, 1835 to Martha Tolman Ames and Jesse Ames.  His was a seafaring family, descended from both Pilgrims and Puritans, and bore no relation to the family of Oakes Ames.  In 1868 Jesse Ames purchased a flour mill in Northfield, Minnesota, which the family developed into a flourishing business.  Adelbert Ames graduated from West Point in 1861 and immediately entered the Union Army.  A highly decorated officer, he fought in the Battle of Bull Run, for which he received the Congressional Medal of Honor.  During his military service, Ames met General Benjamin F. Butler and, later, Butler's daughter, Blanche, whom he married in 1870.  In 1868, Ames was appointed Provisional Governor of Mississippi, later serving that state as U.S. Senator (1870-1873) and Governor (1873-1876).  After his stint in the South, he moved back to Lowell, Massachusetts and turned his attention the family milling business, which interests he represented in the East. He returned briefly to the battlefield during the Spanish-American War, serving as commander of U.S. volunteers.  Adelbert Ames died in Ormond, Florida on April 13, 1933, the last surviving general of the Civil War.</p>

<p>Blanche Butler was born in 1845 to Sarah Hildreth Butler and Benjamin F. Butler.  She spent a lot of time with her father in Washington, D.C., where she met her future husband, Adelbert Ames, with whom she had six children:  Butler, Edith, Sarah, Blanche, Adelbert, Jr., and Jessie.  Blanche Butler Ames did extensive genealogical research on her family, and the portion of the Ames Family Papers pertaining to her life includes a great deal of historical and genealogical information.  She was also a gardener and a sculptor known for her fanciful creations, numerous photographs of which are in the collection. In 1935 she compiled a collection of letters that the family published in 1957 as Chronicles From the Nineteenth Century: Family Letters of Blanche Butler and Adelbert Ames.  Blanche Butler Ames died in 1939. </p> 

<p><title render="underline">Oliver Ames III</title></p>

<p>Oliver Ames III was born in North Easton, Massachusetts on February 4, 1831, the son of Evelina Gilmore and Oakes Ames.  He married Anna Coffin Ray with whom he had six children: Anna Lee, Evelina, Lilian, Oakes, Susan, and William Hadwen.  He served as governor of Massachusetts from 1887 to 1890. Ames was elected an honorary member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia music fraternity in 1917, by the fraternity's Alpha Chapter at the New England Conservatory in Boston. He is the only known honorary member known to be elected after his death.  Oliver Ames III died on October 22, 1895.
</p>

<p><title render="underline">Paul Butler</title></p>

<p>Paul Butler, married to Joanna H. Butler, had numerous business interests, including the Lowell (Massachusetts) Airport Corp., the U. C. Cartridge Co., and the Butler Ranch in Colorado.  He died in Lowell on September 6, 1918.</p>

<p><title render="bold">Generation IV</title></p>

<p><title render="underline">Adelbert Ames, Jr.</title></p>

<p>Adelbert Ames, Jr., an ophthalmologist and perceptual psychologist, was born on August 19, 1880 in Lowell, Massachusetts to Blanche Butler Ames and Adelbert Ames.  He attended Phillips Academy at Andover and earned his undergraduate and law degrees at Harvard in 1903 and 1906, respectively.  He was married to Fanny Vose Hazen, with whom he had two children: Adelbert III and Priscilla.  After working as a lawyer in Boston for four years, Ames abandoned that career and turned to painting.  He collaborated with his sister, Blanche Ames Ames, in developing the System of Color Theory, which involved mixing and charting over three thousand different color variations.  This in turn led to an interest in the physics of how the human eye perceives color.  In 1914 Ames received a research grant in physiological optics and moved to Worcester, Massachusetts to work with Clark University professor Wallace Baird in that field.  He served as an aerial observer in World War I and afterwards (due to Baird's death) relocated to Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire to work with Charles Proctor.  Fascinated by his inquisitive mind, the Dartmouth administration created the faculty post of Professor of Physiological Optics for Ames, wherein he did not teach and was free to devote all his energies to research.  Around 1924 Ames's work yielded the important discovery that in certain people the two eyes do not perceive the same object in the same dimensions; many suffered from debilitating headaches as a result, the source of which had mystified doctors for years.  The condition was named "aniseikonia," the Dartmouth Eye Institute was subsequently founded, and people flocked to it for successful treatment in the form of compensating lenses.  Ames was also famous for creating the American Indian bust that Shawmut Bank of Boston adopted as its trademark, and he was well-known for inventing the Ames Demonstrations in Perception, the most famous of which is a full-sized room that looks normal but in which people appear to shrink as they walk across it.  He also discovered that as many as 20% of humankind cannot perceive level when they see it, a matter of obvious concern to naval aviation, and he worked extensively with aircraft carrier pilots during World War II.  After the war he took up the problem of vision in automobile traffic, and his findings have been instrumental to the work of U.S. highway departments and safety organizations.  Adelbert Ames, Jr. died in 1955.</p>

<p><title render="underline">Blanche Ames Ames and Oakes Ames</title></p>

<p>Blanche Ames was born in Lowell, Massachusetts on February 18, 1878 to Blanche Butler Ames and Adelbert Ames.  She attended the Rogers Hall School in Lowell and earned her B.A. from Smith College in 1899.  She married Harvard botanist Oakes Ames (unrelated) in 1900, with whom she had four children: Amyas, Evelyn, Oliver and Pauline.  Blanche Ames Ames was an accomplished artist, perhaps best known for the botanical drawings undertaken to illustrate her husband's work.  She was a talented portraitist as well, and her oil portraits are in collections at Columbia University, Harvard University, Dartmouth College, Phillips Exeter Academy, and the Mississippi Hall of Governors.  In collaboration with her brother, Adelbert Ames, Jr., she developed the System of Color Theory, based on the relationship between how the human eye perceives color and how painters depict it.  Ames was a tireless and dauntless activist for women's rights, notably suffrage and birth control.  She was Treasurer of the Massachusetts Woman Suffrage League from 1915 to 1918, and in 1916 co-founded and served as first President of the Birth Control League of Massachusetts.  Her interest in women's health led her to serve first as board member and later as President of New England Hospital for Women and Children in Boston.  At the age of eighty, Ames researched and wrote Adelbert Ames, <title render="italic">Broken Oaths and Reconstruction in Mississippi, 1835-1933</title>, in which she defended her father, Adelbert Ames, whom John F. Kennedy had termed a carpetbagger in his book, <title render="italic">Profiles in Courage</title>.  Ames was also an inventor and applied for patents for a hexagonal lumber cutter (1939), a propeller snare to bring down low-flying aircraft during World War II (1945), and an anti-polluting toilet (1968).  Blanche Ames Ames died at Borderland, her home in North Easton, Massachusetts, on March 1, 1969.

<p>Blanche Ames Ames's husband, Oakes Ames, was born in North Easton, Massachusetts on September 26, 1874 to Anna Coffin Ray and Oliver Ames III, former governor of Massachusetts.  He attended the Noble and Greenough School in Boston and earned his undergraduate and graduate degrees in botany at Harvard in 1898 and 1899, respectively.  He was instructor in botany at Harvard from 1900 to 1910, assistant professor from 1915 to 1926, and professor from 1926 to 1932.  He served as Arnold Professor of Botany from 1932 until 1935, and as research professor of botany from 1935 to 1941.  After his 1941 retirement he held the title of research professor emeritus until his death.  In addition to teaching at Harvard, Ames also held numerous administrative posts, including Chairman of the Division of Biology from 1926 to 1935; Assistant Director of the Botanic Garden from 1899 to 1909, and director from 1909 to 1922; Curator of the Botanical Museum from 1923 to 1927; Supervisor of the Biological Laboratory and Botanic Garden in Cuba and of the Arnold Arboretum from 1927 to 1935; and Supervisor of the Botanical Museum from 1937 to 1945, Director of the museum from 1937 to 1945, and Associate Director from 1945 until 1950.  Ames's independent family wealth allowed him to pursue intensively the study of orchids, and he was the foremost orchidologist of his day.  He traveled worldwide, taking copious notes and collecting specimens; as a result of his work, orchids are today among the best studied of plant families.  Oakes Ames died in Ormond, Florida on April 28, 1950.</p>

<scopecontent id="scope">

<p>The Ames Family Papers consist of 78 linear feet of biographical materials, correspondence, diaries, artwork, writings, photographs, and printed materials dating from 1812 to 2012.  The bulk of the collection pertains to suffragist and early birth control advocate, Blanche Ames Ames, and to her father, Civil War general Adelbert Ames; the papers of her daughter, Pauline Ames Plimpton, are also significant in volume.  Other family members are included through their biographical materials, correspondence and, in some cases, their writings.  There is also considerable genealogical information about the extended Ames and Butler families, compiled primarily by Blanche Butler Ames and added to over time by other family members, that traces the family's roots back to its European origins.</p>

<p>Correspondence comprises a large part of the collection and reveals the inner workings of numerous primary family relationships, as well as offering insight into the moral, social, and political climates through a long continuum of U.S. history.  Of particular interest are the courtship letters of Blanche Butler Ames and Adelbert Ames, Blanche Ames Ames and Oakes Ames, and Pauline Ames Plimpton and Francis T.P. Plimpton, as well as life-long correspondence between these couples after they married.  Letters among several sets of mothers, daughters and sisters are also significant, especially in that they span the entire lives of the individuals concerned.</p>

<p>The military careers of Benjamin Franklin Butler and Adelbert Ames are well documented in the portions of the collection pertaining to them.  Legal documents relevant to numerous lawsuits in which Butler was involved may also be of interest to scholars of legal history. Further information about Adelbert Ames is located in the papers of his daughter, Blanche Ames Ames, who researched and wrote <title render="italic">Adelbert Ames: Broken Oaths and Reconstruction in Mississippi, 1835-1933</title> in defense of his political career in Mississippi during Reconstruction, and in SERIES V. CLIPPINGS.</p>

<p>The papers of Blanche Ames Ames contain significant materials about the early birth control movement, especially the Massachusetts Birth Control League.  There is also some information about Margaret Sanger and about other birth control organizations, including the American Birth Control League, in this portion of the collection.  Documents generated during Ames's tenure as board member and as president of the New England Hospital for Women and Children in Boston are included, as well.  Blanche Ames Ames's papers contain information about her career as an amateur artist, including drawings and sketches of family and friends, and information about the System of Color Theory.  There is a small amount of material about the suffrage movement, notably political cartoons by Ames and others.  Ames' papers also shed considerable light on her involvement in the career of her husband, Oakes Ames.</p>
 
<p>Pauline Ames Plimpton wrote several books about various members of the Plimpton family, which document much of that family's history, and the bulk of that information is located in her papers.  Materials about the life of noted literary figure and editor of <title render="italic">The Paris Review</title>, George A. Plimpton, are also included in the collection.</p>

<p>The history of various pieces of real estate owned by the Ames family in the U.S. and in Europe is well documented, most significantly that of Borderland, the North Easton, Massachusetts home of Blanche Ames Ames and Oakes Ames, and the Villa Balbianello on Lake Como in Italy.  There are also files pertaining to Bay View, a compound of summer cottages in Gloucester, Massachusetts; the Whim, the family's winter retreat in Ormond, Florida; and several Boston-area residences.  Photographs of these properties are located in SERIES IV. PHOTOGRAPHS. 
</p>
<p>The bulk of the papers date from 1861 to 1995 and focus primarily on the Civil War, Reconstruction, birth control, suffrage, and the personal and professional lives of members of the Ames family.  Types of material include correspondence, diaries, writings, speeches, legal documents, photographs, journal articles, newspaper clippings, memorabilia, and printed sources.</p>

		<acqinfo id="admin-acqinfo">
			<p>Blanche Ames Ames gave the first installment of her papers to the Sophia Smith Collection in 1968, shortly before she died, and her four children added to the collection after her death in 1969.  In 1978 the Commonwealth of Massachusetts donated Blanche Ames Ames papers that had remained in storage at the Ames family home, Borderland, after it became a state park in 1971.  Pauline Ames Plimpton continued to augment the collection and encouraged the family to do the same; her son, Oakes A. Plimpton, donated her papers after her death in 1995.  The Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation donated additional materials from Borderland in 2013.  Numerous other family members have added their own papers, as well as documents pertaining to their relatives.  Other donors of record include Evelyn Ames Davis, Sarah Gay Plimpton, and Harriet Robey.</p>

<scopecontent>
<p>This series contains information about various properties owned by the extended Ames and Butler families.  The nine subseries are listed alphabetically either by property name or by the town or city in which it is, or was, located: Bay View, Borderland, Boston, Highland Meadows, Oakes Ames Memorial Hall, The Whim, Winthrop Ames Mansion, Miscellaneous U.S. Real Estate, and Villa Balbianello.  The histories of Borderland, now a Massachusetts state park, and Villa Balbianello, now owned by the Italian government, are documented particularly well.  Types of materials include correspondence, contracts and leases, deeds, floor plans, drawings, maps, financial information, and reports.  Information that is limited to the residences of nuclear families (as opposed to family compounds, jointly owned properties, or real estate ultimately taken over by state or national governments) is located in SERIES III. INDIVIDUALS.  Photographs of many of the buildings and grounds described in this series may be found in SERIES IV. PHOTOGRAPHS.</p>

<scopecontent>
<p>This series comprises the bulk of the collection, and is arranged first by generation and then alphabetically by last name.  Spouses follow directly after the member of the Ames and Butler families to whom they are, or were, married.  Correspondence in this series is voluminous and is filed primarily by author.  However, the papers of some individuals contain both outgoing and incoming correspondence, when the total volume of a correspondent's papers did not warrant a discrete subseries for that person.  In addition to correspondence, this series contains biographical and financial information and, particularly in the papers of Blanche Butler Ames, Blanche Ames Ames and Pauline Ames Plimpton, extensive files about their writings.  The papers of Blanche Ames Ames richly document the early years of the Massachusetts Birth Control League and related organizations; files pertaining to her suffrage activities, including the cartoons in the Art subseries, are also noteworthy.  Related materials about most individuals in this series are located in SERIES I. FAMILY HISTORY, SERIES II. REAL ESTATE, and SERIES IV. PHOTOGRAPHS; further information about civil, cultural, military and political issues of interest to Adelbert Ames may be found in SERIES V. CLIPPINGS.</p>

<p>This series contains most of the photographs pertaining to the Ames and Butler families, with the following exceptions: Photographs originally found in Blanche Ames Ames's Smith College scrapbook are filed in her biographical subseries, and photographs relating to books are filed with the individual author's papers.  The three subseries follow exactly the arrangement of the first three primary series: Family history, Real estate, and Individuals.  The Real estate and Individuals subseries are extensive and contain formal portraits as well as casual photographs of the family at work and at play.  </p>
