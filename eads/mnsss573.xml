<bioghist id="bioghist">
       
     <p>Catharine Kerlin was born in Camden, New Jersey the daughter of Ward Dix Kerlin, co-owner of
the Camden Forge, and Sarah Jenney Gilbert Kerlin, a women's suffrage activist on the state level
and then, after 1920, active in the League of Women Voters.  Theirs was a fairly prosperous family
and the Kerlin children, Catharine and her two brothers, attended private schools, mostly those run
by Quakers, and spent their summers at camps in northern New Hampshire.  Catharine Kerlin graduated
from Smith College in 1929 with a degree in history; her honors thesis, directed by the eminent
historian Merle Curti, focused on the Anti-Imperialist League in 1900.  After graduation, she
travelled in Europe for a few months before settling down in Geneva to work for the American
Committee to the League of Nations which was sponsored by the Carnegie Endowment for International
Peace.  Such private funding was necessary, of course, because the US had never signed the Treaty
of Versailles nor joined the organization that grew out of that treaty, the League of Nations.
Nonethless, the international peace movement in the interwar years was a vibrant, active community,
one in which Catherine Kerlin was a very much a part of.</p>

 <p>However, unlike her friend, Hope Sewell French, who made such work her life's career, Kerlin chose
a more conventional path.  She had first met Amos Niven Wilder, a theologian and poet (and brother
of the novelist/playwright, Thornton Wilder), in 1929, shortly after she arrived in Europe.  But it
was when they met again in the summer of 1934 that a romance began and a year later, the couple
married in August, 1935.  In the year before she married, Catharine Kerlin Wilder taught history at
the Friends Academy in Locust Valley, New York; she had previously taught history as well as
English at the International School of Geneva. Thereafter, it was Amos Niven Wilder's career which
directed the family's life.  When the couple first married, Amos Wilder was a professor of the New
Testament at Andover Newton Theological School in Newton, Massachusetts.  By the time he accepted a
position at the Chicago Theological School in 1943, Catharine Kerlin Wilder had given birth to
Catharine Dix Wilder ("Dixie") in 1937 and Amos Tappan Wilder ("Tappy") in 1940.  In 1954, Wilder
was named Hollis Professor of Divinity at Harvard Divinity School and the family then moved back
east, settling in Cambridge, spending summers in their second home in South Blue Hill, Maine.</p>
<p>Throughout these years, Catharine Kerlin Wilder, as one obituary put it, "played a prominent role
as a faculty spouse."  She was also active in clubs, joining the prestigious Saturday Morning Club
in Boston in 1961, and engaged in charitable work for the public library and the Kneisel Hall
School of Music, both in Blue Hill.  After his retirement in 1963, the Wilders travelled  around
the world extensively for the next few decades.  A few years after her husband died in 1993,
Catharine Kerlin Wilder moved to a nursing home in Brunswick, Maine, closer to her daughter.  In
2000, she published her memoir entitled <title render="italic">Milestones in My Life</title>.  Three month shy of her 100th birthday, Catharine Kerlin Wilder died in Maine and is buried next to her husband in Mount Carmel
Burial Ground, Hamden, Connecticut.</p>

     <p>The collection includes correspondence, photographs, scapbooks, childhood memorabilia, drafts
of memoirs, and essays written by Wilder.  Especially well documented are her years in Geneva (1929-
1934) when she worked at the League of Nations.  Her childhood, especially her summer camp
experiences, are also well represented.  Also of interest is the American women's suffrage campaign
material, amassed by Wilder's mother, including correspondence, pamphlets, speeches, and
memorabilia.  Finally, this collection includes papers of Wilder's friend Hope Sewell French during
her years (1930s) working for the League of Nations in Geneva, including correspondence,
photographs, scrapbook, and articles, written by French and others.</p>
