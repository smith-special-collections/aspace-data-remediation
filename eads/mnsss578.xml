<p>	Ida Belle Gwynn Garvin was born October 4, 1869, in Jefferson Township, Ohio, to farmers Adaline Root and Ira Gwynn. She married farmer Norman S. Garvin and settled first in Richland Township, then Hale Township, Ohio.  The Garvins had seven children: Gwynn (b. 1898), Juanita (b. 1900), Irma (b. 1903), Gage (b. 1906), Daniel (b. 1909), Amer (b. 1913) and Edwin (b. 1914). Ida Garvin seems to have been widowed not long after the birth of her last child, although there is conflicting information about her husband's date of death.</p>

<p>Garvin contracted tuberculosis, and in 1916 spent time in Nob Hill Lodge Sanitarium in Colorado Springs, Colorado, leaving the children in the care of her mother. Her doctors recommended moving to a dry climate, so she conceived the idea of homesteading in Montana, not far from her brother, John Gwynn in Chouteau County.  In late 1916 Garvin signed papers to take over a relinquished property near Loma, Montana. She lived on the property with her children until February 1918, when illness forced her to move in with her brother and sister-in-law in Loma.  From that time, Garvin moved back and forth between Loma and the homestead, depending on her health and on the severity of the weather, perfecting her claim to the property on June 12, 1920. Ida Belle Gwynn Garvin died in the hospital at Fort Benton, Montana, on January 29, 1921.</p>

<p>	The Ida Belle Gwynn Garvin Papers primarily consist of letters from Ida Gwynn Garvin to her mother, Adaline Gwynn.  The letters span the years 1916 (when Garvin was hospitalized for tuberculosis at a sanatorium in Colorado Springs, Colorado), through 1920 (three months before she died), when she and her children attempted homesteading on a claim near Loma, Montana.  The Papers also include some biographical information about and photographs of the Gwynn and Garvin families and a couple of letters by Ida Gwynn Garvin's daughters. </p>

<p>Ida Garvin's letters were part of the research for Marcia Meredith Hensley's book, <title render="italic">Staking Her Claim: Women Homesteading the West</title> (High Plains Press, 2008).</p>
