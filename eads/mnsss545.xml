     <p>MUSE Cincinnati Women's Choir was founded in 1983 by Dr. Catherine Roma, who served as the
organization's Artistic Director from the Choir's founding until her retirement in 2013. The Choir
is part of the larger women's music movement that emerged between the 1970s and 1990s in an effort
to combine work for social change and the powerful love of music. According to the organization's
mission statement, MUSE is "dedicated to musical excellence and social change" and works to spread
"their message of peace and unity through music" through performances in the United States and the
international community.</p>
