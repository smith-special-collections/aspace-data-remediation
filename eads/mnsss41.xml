               <unittitle>Series I. CORRESPONDENCE</unittitle>
            </did>
            <scopecontent>
               <p>This series consists of two sections, General and Family. Other letters are filed according to subject in other series.</p>
               <p>General correspondence is arranged in alphabetical order.  A large number of letters from former students in Egypt, India, and Pakistan provide a view of social work in these countries.  Other correspondents whose letters are of special interest are Madhav Gore, principal of the Delhi School of Social Work from 1953 to 1962, who has corresponded with Miss Lucke for more than thirty years about the school's development and about social work in India; Talitha Gerlach, employee of the Y.W.C.A. and the China Welfare Institute in Shanghai, who has written to Miss Lucke since the end of World War II; and Ruth Rickover, wife of a U.S. naval officer stationed in China, whose letters describe events at the time of the Japanese invasion of China in 1938.</p>
               <p>There are copies of letters by Elmina Lucke to the Gore family and to former students at the end of this section.</p>
               <p>Family correspondence consists of letters from Miss Lucke written while traveling abroad.  They contain detailed descriptions of places she visited and people she met and are also expressive of her closeness to her family.  There are also letters from various family members.</p>

               <unittitle>Series II. PROFESSIONAL ACTIVITIES</unittitle>
            </did>
            <scopecontent>
               <p>This series consists of ten sections which document Elmina Lucke's long career as an educator, researcher, administrator, and consultant. These materials are concentrated on her work abroad from 1930 to 1968.  There is no documentation of her earliest work in high school teaching, for the Children's Bureau, and as founder and director of the International Institute of Detroit, but Miss Lucke recalls some of those experiences in her oral history.</p>
               <p>The Investigation of the Social Studies in the Schools section contains papers from a trip Miss Lucke took in l930-3l with a grant from the American Historical Association which had undertaken this investigation in l929.  There is correspondence, reports about educational systems in some of the countries she visited, printed materials, and miscellaneous papers.  Reminiscences about this trip may be found in <ref target="list-ser3">Series III</ref>.</p>
               <p>The Lincoln School section contains a variety of materials about Miss Lucke's twenty-year association with the school.  Documents include correspondence, research notes, clippings, publications, a bibliography, and two drafts of social studies curricula for high schools.  Letters of her former Lincoln students, including David Rockefeller, are in <ref target="list-ser1">Series I</ref>.</p>
               <p>The Delhi School of Social Work section contains correspondence, reports, publications, and a variety of printed materials produced by the school, established under the auspices of the Y.W.C.A. in 1946.  There are documents and published accounts about her work as the founder and director of the school.
