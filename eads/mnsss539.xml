     <p>Alice Orcutt Howell was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the daughter of Penelope King and
Reginald Wilson Orcutt.  From the age of five, she lived abroad with her parents, traveling through
thirty-seven countries on four continents by the age of eighteen.  They lived in hotels and
boarding schools, never staying more than three months in one place, and Howell became fluent in
English, French, German and Italian.  She earned a Deutsch Diploma at the Buser Institute in
Switzerland with a major in German literature and a minor in World History, and later took
postgraduate courses at the New York School for Social Research.  Disillusioned with traditional
Christianity and searching for spiritual meaning, beginning at age thirteen Howell read the holy
books of many of the great religions, including the Bible, the Koran, the Upanishads, the
Dhammapada, and the Tao Te Ching, as well as Greek and Norse mythology. She also studied the work
of Jung, Freud, St. Ignatius and William James, as well as that of prominent astrologers.  In 1944
she began a serious study of astrology under Marc Edmund Jones.  She married Douglass Morse Howell
and with him raised four children. She taught English and History in private schools on Long
Island, New York for eighteen years, and also worked as a secretary to several people, including
Norman Cousins, Editor of the Saturday Review of Literature, and Walter Russell, sculptor and
physicist.  During World War II, Howell worked in the U.S. Office of Censorship, censoring German
and French mail in New York City.</p>

   <p>Beginning in mid-life, Howell's interests in religion,
astrology and psychology coalesced and her life took a different turn.  Her most important
professional contribution has been to "prove astrology a useful diagnostic adjunct to Jungian
psychology", and for many years she taught the subject to analysts at the Jung Foundation and at
the C. G. Jung Institutes in Chicago and Los Angeles.  Howell has traveled the world, lectured
widely, led many seminars, and is the author of nine books: <title render="italic">Jungian Symbolism in Astrology</title> (1987),
<title render="italic">Dove in the Stone: Finding the Sacred in the Commonplace</title> (1988), <title render="italic">Jungian Synchronicity in the
Astrological Signs and Ages: Letters From An Astrologer </title>(1990), H<title render="italic">ow Like An Angel I Came Down:
Conversations With Children on the Gospels</title> (1991), <title render="italic">Web in the Sea: Jung, Sophia, and the Geometry
of the Soul</title> (1993), <title render="italic">Beejum book</title> (2002), <title render="italic">Lara's First Christmas</title> (2004), <title render="italic">Heavens Declare:
Astrological Ages and the Evolution of Consciousness </title>(2006), and <title render="italic">From the Archives of the Heart:
Collected Poems </title>(2010). In 1980 she married her second husband, Walter A. Anderson, who died in 1998. Alice Howell died in Monterey, MA, on October 28, 2014.</p>
