       <p>American poet Lola Ridge was born Rose Emily Ridge in Dublin, Ireland in 1873. At age three she and her mother moved first to Sydney, Australia and then to New Zealand. She took classes through Trinity College (England) and studied art under Julian Ashton at the Academie Julienne in Australia. She moved to New York in 1908. Her radical poetry appeared in <title render="italic">The Ghetto and Other Poems </title>(1918), Emma Goldman's monthly, <title render="italic">Mother Earth</title>, as well as in more mainstream periodicals. She wrote poetry on radical themes, and about her anarchist friends Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman. After World War I, Ridge revived Alfred Kreymborg's magazine, <title render="italic">Others</title>, and served as the American editor of Broom. In 1923 she won Poetry magazine's Guarantor's Prize. During her lifetime, Ridge published five books of poetry, including <title render="italic">Firehead</title>, about the Crucifixion. She completed <title render="italic">Firehead</title> in 1929 at the Yaddo retreat.  In the 1930s she visited Paris and Baghdad, and a Guggenheim fellowship enabled her to travel to Taos, New Mexico, and parts of Mexico. She received the Shelley Memorial Award in 1934 and 1935. Lola Ridge died of cardiomyopathy in 1941.</p>
