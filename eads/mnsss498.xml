          <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Elizabeth Dodson Gray graduated from Smith College in 1951, and earned her BDiv. from Yale
   Divinity School in 1954. In 1957, she married fellow Yale classmate, David Gray, with whom she
   has two children, Hunter and Lisa. From 1957 to 1972, the couple worked together in Epicopal
   parish ministsry, and during the 1970s and 1980s, they taught together at MIT's Sloan School of
   Management, at Williams College, and at Boston College; Elzabeth D. Gray also taught at the
   Antioch New England Graduate School in Keene, New Hampshire. In the early 1970s, Gray "worked
   out for herself a feminist critique of our male-dominated culture," and since 1978 she has
   served as director of the Theological Opportunities Program (TOPS) at Harvard Divinity School,
   which sponsors Thursday morning lectures on a variety of topics having to do with patriarchy,
   ecofeminism, women's interpretation of religious matters, and the like.  In 2000, Gray received
   Yale University's Distinguished Alumni Award.</p>
