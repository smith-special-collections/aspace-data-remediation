     <p>Founded in 1968 and first known as the Center for Family Planning Program Development, the
organization was initially part of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA).  The Center
had as its champion Alan F. Guttmacher, the prestigious obstetrician/gynecologist/educator who
served as PPFA president for more than ten years until his death in 1974.  By 1977, the Center was
renamed the Alan Guttmacher Institute (AGI) in Dr. Guttmacher's honor and incorporated as an
independent non-profit organization with its own Board of Directors, distinct from PPFA.  But its
mission and goals remain the same since its founding.  As stated on their Web site, "The Guttmacher
Institute advances sexual and reproductive health and rights through an interrelated program of
research, policy analysis and public education designed to generate new ideas, encourage
enlightened public debate and promote sound policy and program development. The Institute's
overarching goal is to ensure the highest standard of sexual and reproductive health for all people
worldwide."  To that end, AGI maintains an impressive Web site, making widely available the facts
and figures they so carefully collect. [source:
