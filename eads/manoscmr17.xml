<bioghist id="bioghist">

<p>Philip Hale was born in Norwich, Vermont, on March 5, 1854, the son of William and Harriet Amelia (Porter) Hale.  After his parents moved to Northampton, Mass., he studied organ and piano and became at age fourteen the organist of the Unitarian Church in Northampton.  He studied at Phillips Exeter Academy and at Yale University (A.B., 1876), where he continued his musical studies.  After an apprenticeship in the law office of his uncle in Albany, N.Y., Hale was admitted to the New York Bar in 1880 and practiced law for two years.  At the same time he was organist of St. Peter's (Episcopal) Church and was music critic for the Albany Times.  This was followed by five years of music study in Europe (1882-1887), largely in Berlin, Dresden and Paris.</p>  

<p>Upon his return to the United States, he lived in Albany, N.Y., served as organist at St. John's (Episcopal) Church in Troy and served as music critic for a variety of newspapers.  In 1889 he became the organist for the First Religious Society (Unitarian) of Roxbury, Mass., and held the position for seventeen years.  In Boston he served as music critic for the Post (1890-1891) and the Journal (1892-1898).   At the Herald (1903-1933) he served as music and drama critic and became known for his program notes for the Boston Symphony Orchestra (1901-1934).</p>  

<p>Philip Hale married Irene Baumgras in Berlin, Germany, July 9, 1884, the daughter of Peter Baumgras of Washington, D.C.  Hale died in Boston on November 30, 1934.</p>  

<p>Hale was also the editor of <title render="italic">Musical Record</title> (1897-1901) and the <title render="italic">Musical World</title> (1901-1902) and edited or wrote introductions to various editions of music.  After his death a compilation of his program notes was published: <title render="italic">Philip Hale's Boston Symphony Programme Notes</title>, edited by John N. Burk (Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, Doran, 1935).</p>  

<p>[Sources: "Philip Hale," <title render="italic">The National Cyclopaedia of American Biography</title>, 14 (1917): 462-463; "Philip Hale," <title render="italic">Groves Music Online</title> (2006)]</p>
