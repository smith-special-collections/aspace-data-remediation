         <p> Florence Seaver was born in Massachusetts on April 26, 1867.  Her father, Nathanial Seaver was a Unitarian minister who served various churches including those in Leicester, Millbury, and Pittsfield, Massachusetts.  She graduated from Smith College in 1889 and went on to teach high school in North Easton, Massachusetts.  In 1895 she married George Albert Slocomb, a well-known Worcester physician.  She became active in the Unitarian church and was a prominent figure in the Worcester Women's Club where she advocated for the causes of women's education and prison reform.  By the turn-of-the-century, she was well-known for her work for woman suffrage and for pure food.  She provided wartime service through War Camp Community Service in 1919-1920 and was appointed a member of the Woman's Committee, Council of National Defense. With the passage of the 19th amendment in 1920, she became active in the League of Women Voters.  In 1924 she was appointed to the Council of Women and Children in Industry and, in 1926 was the first woman from Worcester County elected to the Massachusetts State Legislature.  In the 1930s she was a staunch advocate for jury service for women.  She also lectured and wrote for various magazines.  She died in 1955.</p>
