<p>Jill Ker Conway was the first female president of the college. Her selection, a watershed in the history of Smith, was also a hallmark in an era of significant change in the perception of women and their role in society. In her inaugural address, she stressed the importance of not only supporting women through their undergraduate education, but furthering the college mission "...to foster research and the creation of new knowledge about matters of central importance in women's lives." Some of the most significant accomplishments of her tenure reflect this vision. She focused much of her energy on developing and funding women-centered projects such as the Smith Management Program,  Ada Comstock Program, and Project on Women and Social Change.</p>
<p>Conway was only 39 years old when she accepted the Smith appointment in 1974. A native of New South Wales, Australia, she received her undergraduate education at the University of Sydney (1958). Two years after completing her B.A., she left Australia to pursue her Ph.D. at Harvard University. While at Harvard, she met and married John Conway, a Canadian historian and a native of Toronto. Together they moved to Canada where both obtained positions at the University of Toronto. Jill Conway remained at the University of Toronto for more than ten years, beginning in 1964. She began as a professor of U.S. social and intellectual history, then gradually rose through the administrative ranks to serve as the vice-president for internal affairs (1973-1975).</p>
<p>Conway assumed the Smith presidency in July 1975. Several administrative and curricular changes were enacted during her tenure. Administrative offices, such as the Career Development Office (previously the Vocational Office), Dean of the College, Dean of Students, and Public Relations, were reorganized. The Women's Studies, Comparative Literature, Peace and War Studies, and Engineering Dual Degree programs were added to the curriculum during this period, and academic minors were introduced.</p>
<p>Lasting physical reminders of her presidency include the Ainsworth Gym, expanded outdoor athletic facilities, as well as renovation and additions to Neilson Library. The Alumnae Gymnasium was also renovated during this period, and became home to the Smith College Archives, the Sophia Smith Collection, and the Nonprint Resource Center.</p>
<p>Following her departure from the college in 1985, Conway has been a visiting professor in MIT's Program in Science, Technology, and Society. She has also authored and edited a number of books of fiction and nonfiction. Three volumes of her memoirs provide detailed biographical information about Conway. The third volume (released October 2001), chronicles her years at Smith. While this volume deals with Conway's personal as well as professional development,  and is admittedly from a singular perspective, it can serve as a guide to the major developments of Smith College during her tenure.</p>

<scopecontent id="scope">

<p>The Conway Files include approximately 95 linear feet (226 document boxes) of material dating from 1974-1985. Some material has been restricted according the College Archives policies. The open records (154 document boxes/ 64.5 linear feet) include incoming and outgoing correspondence, reports and working papers, newspaper clippings and photographs. For more specific information about the contents of the collection see the series descriptions and folder listing below. See the Subject Guide on pages 9-12 of this finding aid for a list of topics of a broad nature.</p>
<p>Additional material in the Smith College Archives about the Conway era may be found in the records of other departments and offices of the college, as well as in the personal papers of Jill Ker Conway. The central secondary literature on Smith's Conway era comes from Conway herself. She has authored a number of articles and full-length works on her professional and intellectual development, which amply describe her evolving perceptions on the intersections of women's education, history and feminism. Even a cursory internet search yields a wealth of biographical information about Conway, as well as details and commentary on her literary career and continuing involvement with women's education. See the list of publications in the finding aid for Conway's personal papers for a comprehensive list of publications.</p>

<p>The records in this series include newspaper clippings, press releases, and correspondence relating to Conway's appointment, presidency and retirement. Included with the material about her appointment are a series of subject files she compiled while preparing to take office. These files offer an interesting perspective on the priorities of various college officials, departments and offices, as well as Conway herself. There is also information in this series about Conway's husband, John Conway, and a 1996 student paper about the official presidential portrait painted by Sarah Swenson.

<p>More extensive biographical material can be found in Jill Ker Conway's personal papers, as well as her published works. [There is additional oversized material from this series stored separately. Ask College Archivist for Flat Files list.]</p>

<arrangement>
<p>The files in this series are arranged alphabetically by the most recent name of the department.
</p>
</arrangement>
<scopecontent>
<p>Included are newspaper clippings, correspondence, and reports from the undergraduate departments of the college. Also included are programs administered by the departments. For example, files from the Smith College Day Schools are included as a sub-series of the Department of Education. However, undergraduate and graduate academic programs administered either jointly by two or more departments, or by a separate and autonomous college office, are filed either with Academic Programs or Administrative Offices. Graduate Programs are filed in the Graduate Work series. Information about Five College joint academic programs in several areas of study can be found in the Intercollegiate Associations series.

<unittitle>SERIES IV. ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUES</unittitle>
<physdesc>
<extent>(10 document boxes / 4.2 linear feet)</extent>
</physdesc>
</did>
<scopecontent>
<p>This series documents activity in the President's Office which is either of a general nature, requiring the attention of only the president and her closest assistants, or requiring the participation of a number of administrative bodies at once. Included in this series are records relating to a number of general issues, such as Legislators and Legislation, Lesbianism, Race, and Women's Education. At the end of the series there is a collection of miscellaneous correspondence handled by the President's Office, filed in alphabetical order. Several issues, such as lesbianism, race and women's education, pervaded many areas of campus activity and were handled by several offices and departments. Because material on these topics can be found under a variety of headings, a Subject Guide has been provided on pages 9-12 of this finding aid to assist the researcher.

<p>The Administrative Offices series is the largest series in the Conway records. It includes correspondence and reports from individual offices as well as newspaper clippings and other general information about their activities and functions.  Development comprises the largest section of the Administrative Offices series, specifically because fundraising became a much more significant part of the duties of the President during Conway's tenure than in previous administrations.

<unittitle>SERIES VI. ALUMNAE</unittitle>
</did>
<scopecontent>
<p>This series includes material on a number of issues related to the alumnae, as well as the Alumnae Association and its activities. The bulk of the files contain information about the Alumnae Association, class reunions, Smith Clubs, and specific individuals. The section related to individuals is in alphabetical order, and contains correspondence to, from and about alumnae. Many are routine and pro forma letters of thank you for attending certain functions, or congratulations on administrative successes. However, there are also letters scattered throughout addressing specific issues pertinent to the period. There is also a file of birthday greetings sent to alumnae by the President's Office, generally offering congratulations on reaching a remarkably advanced age.
</p>
</scopecontent>
<relatedmaterial>
<p>Information about alumnae involvement with Admissions can be found in the records of Alumnae/Admissions Task Force in the Committees and Boards series, and in the records of the Admissions Office's Candidates Committees in the Administrative Offices series.

<unittitle>SERIES IX. COMMITTEES AND BOARDS</unittitle>
</did>
<accessrestrict>
<p>However, college policy and the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act require the restriction of the records of both the Board of Trustees and the Board of Counselors.</p>
</accessrestrict>
<scopecontent>
<p>This series includes correspondence, reports and working papers of the standing and ad-hoc committees and boards of the college. The most central and far-reaching decision-making bodies are the Board of Trustees, the Board of Counselors, and the Committee on Planning and Resources (previously the College Planning Committee and the Faculty Planning Committee).  Other significant committees in this series include several faculty committees, the Committee on Social Responsibility and the Committee on Student Affairs. Also included in this series are three free-standing administrative groups: Administrative Department Heads, Senior Administrative Group, and Senior Staff. The files of the Senior Staff are the most extensive of these three groups. The Senior Staff (also know as the President's Staff) included key administrative figures, such as the Treasurer, the Directors of Development and Public Relations, Assistants to the President, and Deans and Associate Deans. Minutes and major reports from most committees are available in the Dean of the Faculty Records of the Smith College Archives.

<unittitle>SERIES XIV. INTERCOLLEGIATE ASSOCIATIONS</unittitle>
</did>
<scopecontent>
<p>There are six intercollegiate associations included in this series: Five Colleges, Inc., Seven Sisters, Society Organized Against Racism, Ten Universities Group, Twelve-College Exchange, and Women's College Coalition.</p>
<p>Five Colleges: The Five Colleges material includes correspondence, reports and newspaper clippings tracing the evolution of cooperative relations between Smith College, Mount Holyoke College, Hampshire College, Amherst College, and the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.</p>
<p>Seven Sisters: The records of the Seven Sisters (also known as the Seven Colleges) include correspondence, reports and newspaper clippings documenting relations between seven of the most important historically women-only colleges in the Eastern United States: Barnard, Bryn Mawr, Mount Holyoke, Radcliffe, Smith, Vassar, and Wellesley.</p>
<p>Society Organized Against Racism (SOAR): The SOAR records include correspondence and reports documenting the founding and early activity of the organization. SOAR, founded in 1982, is a consortium of New England colleges and universities working to improve the racial climate in academic institutions.</p>
<p>Ten Universities Group: The Ten Universities Group file includes the records of a July 1980 conference on issues related to faculty and tenure. The Ten Universities were the California Institute of Technology, Carnegie Mellon University, Case Western Reserve University, Dartmouth College, Duke University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Princeton University, Rochester University, Vanderbilt University, and Washington University.</p>
<p>Twelve-College Exchange: The Twelve-College Exchange files include records of the student exchange program begun in 1968 which eventually included the following institutions: Smith, Amherst, Bowdoin, Connecticut, Dartmouth, Mount Holyoke, Trinity, Vassar, Wellesley, Wesleyan, Wheaton, and Williams. The program had a publicly stated purpose of expanding the collegiate experience for the students, but privately was initiated as an experiment in coeducation for several traditionally single-sex institutions.</p>
<p>Women's College Coalition: The Women's College Coalition was founded in 1972 under the auspices of the Association of American Colleges. It includes more than seventy two- and four-year colleges. The material in this collection includes correspondence, reports and announcements of the organization's events and projects.
