       <p>Adelaide Wellington was born in Tioga, Pennsylvania in 1867, the third child of
Quincy Winthrop Wellington and Matilda Wickham.  She married Alanson Bigelow Houghton and
had five children.  They lived in Corning, New York. The Houghton family dominated the civic and religious life of the community. Adelaide traveled abroad with her husband who was involved in international politics.</p>

       <p>Privately printed diary covering the years when Houghton's husband Alanson was
involved in public life, from the time he went to Congress in 1918, to serving as U.S.
ambassador to Berlin (1922-25) and to London (1925-29), and then his return to Washington
(1929-41).  The diary ceases on the day of Alanson Houghton's death in 1941. From the
Foreward to the diary: "Much of the truth of the diary lies between its lines.  It
understates the significance of the events it describes.  It was not that [Adelaide Houghton] felt them less strongly, but that she accepted life for what it was, quietly, gracefully, imaginatively, with humor, and with more than one grain of salt."</p>
