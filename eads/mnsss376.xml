    <head>Historical Note</head>
       <p>Women and Life on Earth was founded in August 1979, after the accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania by 12 women from the northeastern U.S. who were active in anti-nuclear, alternative energy, peace and women's organizations.  They were concerned about the "proliferation of nuclear weapons and technologies, toxic wastes, urban decay, and ecologically destructive means of production," and the threats posed to the quality of life on earth.  They formed WLOE to "bring these concerns into the political arena."  The organization's kick-off event was a conference: "Women and Life on Earth: A Conference on Eco-Feminism in the '80s," held in March 1980 (the spring equinox) at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.  It brought together 600 women from the northeastern U.S.  WLOE took advantage of the momentum generated by the conference and organized the Women's Pentagon Action, an anti-nuclear protest.  In November 1980, 2,000 women encircled the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, demanding "no more amazing inventions for death." Women and Life on Earth activities continued in the U.S. and Britain for several years. The original WLOE network's activities ended in 1982.</p>

<p>In 1999 WLOE launched the Women and Life on Earth Internet project "to connect women internationally, share information and support changes necessary to ensure life and peace with justice in the new millennium."  In August 1999 an international board of advisors was formed at a meeting held in western Massachusetts.    In 2001 the project moved to Berlin, Germany with coordinator Anna Gyorgy, and the 'war on terror' that followed the September 11, 2001 attacks in the U.S., and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq "gave further proof of the need for international communication and solidarity for peace with justice."</p>

	<p>In January 2004 the German-based association (full name: "Women and Life on Earth: women for international cooperation for peace, ecology and social justice") was granted non-profit status.  They currently have an active email mailing list and Web site, and publish an electronic newsletter in German and English, to report on "women and peace, globalization and ecology."   It also organizes local programs and guest speakers. [Source: WLOE Web site:
