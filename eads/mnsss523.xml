     <p>Sisters Inc. (sometimes known as Sisters Ink) was a small, community-based organization in the rural hilltowns of Western Massachusetts from 1996-2008.  It was started by local women in the community who wanted to support girls as they entered adolescence by creating a "hardiness zone," a community in which girls could flourish and remain bold and strong.  Founded by Ellen Pulleyblank Coffey and Deborah Coffey, the organization was directed by Kelly Anderson for most of its tenure. Programs included:  an art-based mentoring program for girls ages 9-12, a music based program for teen girls, a mother-daughter reading group, self-defense workshops, and annual art exhibits, lectures, and public events aimed at creating dialogue around the needs and desires of girls.  Over the years, Sisters reached hundreds of rural girls and women and hosted events with Carol Gilligan, Evelyn Harris, Rachel Maddow and others. Sisters Inc was funded by Community Development Block Grants, the Women's Fund of Western Massachusetts, the Berkshire Taconic Foundation, and Local Cultural Councils.  All events and programs were free to participants.  The organization folded in 2008 due to lack of funding.</p>
