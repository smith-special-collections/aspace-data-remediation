<p>"The origins of Rally Day can be traced to a series of annual celebrations for George Washington's birthday, the first of which was held at Smith College in February 1876. Over time, these celebrations evolved from essentially social dinners or receptions into daylong college events. The addition of a 'rally' to the day in 1894 was eventually reflected in the name Rally Day, first used in 1906. The celebration is now held annually on the third Wednesday in February.
</p>
<p>Through the years, students have sponsored and participated in a range of activities: rallies, debates, basketball rivalries, dramatic presentations, singing and dancing. The current tradition of sponsoring an event to benefit a charity began in 1918 when the Rally Day Show was held to raise funds for the Smith College Relief Unit serving in World War I France.
</p>
<p>The Smith College Medal has been awarded to outstanding alumnae at Rally Day since 1973. The medalists have become an important part of the program, speaking prior to convocation in classes and afterward in conversations with students.
</p>
<p>Dress at Rally Day has evolved as well. In 1944, the senior class began wearing its graduation caps and gowns to the convocation. The day still marks the first time the seniors publicly wear their gowns. In recent years, however, the caps have been replaced by inventive hats of the students' choosing (and sometimes of their own making), in keeping with the 'rallying' and spirited nature of the day." (From the Rally Day Convocation Program February 23, 2000)

<p>All of the materials are arranged chronologically except the general files which are arranged alphabetically.
</p>
<p>Additional materials located in the Audio Visual Collection include videos of Rally Day shows, long playing recordings of songs and shows, one digital audio tape of the Glee Club, and audio cassettes of convocation speeches, shows, and a few Smith College Medalists panel discussions.

<p>This series is arranged chronologically.</p>

<scopecontent>
<p>There are press releases and newspaper clippings for
 most, but not all years 1895 - the present. This series
 contains newspaper clippings, handwritten and typed press
 releases, biographical information on Rally Day speakers,
 short advances of speeches, and lists of Rally Day
 committees, crews, and performers. The newspaper
 clippings and press releases cover all aspects of Rally
 Day including speeches, Smith College Medalists,
 basketball games, shows, convocation, Rally Day committee
 members and performers, and dances. Newspaper articles
 are from national, local, and college publications. Most
 of the clippings are from Boston, New York, Connecticut,
 Western Massachusetts, and Smith College newspapers.
 Press coverage is heaviest in the 1930s and dwindling in
 the 1950s. After the 1950s, press coverage is mostly
 limited to local papers such as the Hampshire Gazette and
 Smith College publications. The full texts of speeches
 are located in SERIES VI. CONVOCATION TEXTS. Additional
 information on speakers after 1965 can be found in the
 Honorary Degrees Files.</p>

 student dressed up as George Washington (1896) and
 another dressed up as George Washington's slave (1895).

<p>Most consist of programs, scripts for skits, scores

 Rally Day benefit shows did not start until 1918, concert
 programs and the texts of songs sung at Rally Day
 pre-1918 are included in this series. Many of the songs
 are written to the tunes of popular songs. The text of
 one Rally Day stunt, undated, is in SERIES I. GENERAL.
