	<p>Born in 1891 in Providence, Rhode Island, Louise Russell Howe attended Classical High School before joining the Smith College Class of 1914.  During her time at Smith, she excelled in sports and academics, a member of both the hockey and basketball teams, as well as the prestigious Alpha Honor Society.  After graduation, she attended a two-year program in gymnastics at Wellesley College, and subsequently taught physical education at Walnut Hill School in Natick, Massachusetts.  She eventually became superintendent of physical education for public schools in Duluth, Minnesota, as well as a brief period teaching at the University of Michigan until she married John Harry Marshall in 1926.  Her children included daughter Elizabeth Marshall (1949) and stepson Alden Marshall.  In 1944, Howe used her physiotherapy training to work in the fracture and orthopedic clinics in a Providence hospital.</p>

<p>Until her death in August 1973 at age 82, Howe was active in the Providence Art Club, Women's Alliance of the First Unitarian Church in Providence, and the Rhode Island Smith College Club.  She also served on the board of directors of the Home for Aged Women in Providence.</p>

    <scopecontent id="scope">
	
	<p>The Louise Howe papers include correspondence she received during her time at Smith, primarily consisting of congratulatory notes from friends for her academic and sports-related achievements. These are notes that Howe received upon her acceptance to the prestigious Alpha Society of Smith College, as well as the initial invitation she received from the Alpha Society, and numerous cards that came with flower arrangements.</p>

<p>The collection contains her calendar for 1910. This page-a-day calendar covers the year of 1910. Almost every page contains brief journaling about Howe's day, and a few pages include photographs. Bound with red and white ribbons, the calendar measures 3x4x5 inches. The collection also includes mementos from Smith events such as the Freshman Frolic, Junior Prom, and her suede Alpha Society notepad and pencil.</p>

<p>Miscellaneous items among these papers consist of a report card and newspaper clippings from her senior year at Classical High School.</p>
