    <p> In 1981, Echo (Linda Ray) of the Kansas City Women's Chorus and Linda Small of the St. Louis Women's Choir started the Sister Singers Network with a logo, letterhead, and a list of choruses. Their vision was to create a feminist network of women's choruses that could learn from each other and come together to share music. The early SSN choral festivals were part of the Ozark Women's Festivals, until the SSN outgrew them. The first separate choral festival that was hosted by the SSN was in Kansas City in 1984.  Sister Singers Network has hosted several international women's choral festivals in various cities around the United States, including Kansas City, St. Louis, Madison, Chicago, Minneapolis, Houston, Cincinnati, and Grand Rapids. From 1996 to 1999, the activity of the network dropped significantly and membership lapsed. At the National Women's Music Festival in 1999, a group of chorus women met to discuss revitalizing SSN; later that summer, a mailing went out to all the former SSN choruses, plus any new women's choruses that were known, to invite everyone to a SSN planning meeting in Chicago in October. The Grand Rapids Women's Chorus, with help from Sistrum of Lansing, MI, hosted the next Sister Singers Network Festival in Grand Rapids, Michigan in 2001, which was attended by 26 choruses. The organization is ongoing.</p>
