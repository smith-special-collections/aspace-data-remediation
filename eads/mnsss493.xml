   <bioghist id="bioghist">
          
        <p>Dyke TV was created by Ana Maria Simo (playwright and co-founder of Lesbian Avengers), Linda Chapman (theater director and producer) and Mary Patierno (independent film and video maker).  The first show aired in New York City, June 8, 1993.  Dyke TV produced national documentary television programming, by and for lesbians, designed to empower and to enhance the visibility of diverse lesbian communities; it mixed art, news, sports, political commentary, health coverage, music, and video as it examined issues of lesbian culture. The program reached over 6.5 million households nationwide, and was screened at many national and international film and music festivals. The half-hour weekly cable television show featured a five-minute news segment covering issues relevant to lesbian lives from a lesbian perspective; an in-depth look at an issue of particular interest to the lesbian community, including such topics as the International Dyke March at Stonewall 25, the murder of Brandon Teena, Camp Sister Spirit under siege, lesbians in the military, domestic partnership, and state-wide ballot initiatives and other anti-lesbian and anti-gay activities of the Christian Right; and interviews with lesbian artists, showcasing their work. Dyke TV won a Hometown Video Festival Award in 1994.</p>
