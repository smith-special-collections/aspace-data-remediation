     <p>Linda Stein received her B.A. from Queens College and her M.F.A. from the Pratt Institute.  In 1974, she founded  Have Art: Will Travel! Inc. (HAWT), a non-profit corportation, to help artists, particularly women, to teach, exhibit, and sell their art.  In 1993, she founded the Art Club, a Tribeca gallery providing free exhibit space for non-profit organizations promoting feminism, diversity, and reproductive rights. Stein recently received the National Association of Women Artists award as their 2017 Artist Honoree for Commitment to the Arts.  And in October 2017 the New York City Art Teachers Association/UFT will honor Stein with their Artist of the Year award. </p>

<p>She has exhibited her work in solo and group shows and has been widely published, receives frequent commissions, and is represented in numerous private and museum collections.  Stein is also active in the art world as a panelist and moderator, has appeared on radio and television shows, and is a member of the Board of Directors of the Veteran Feminists of America.  In her own words: "It was as an artist in the 1970s that I became obsessed with the face.... An active feminist, I enjoy making portraits of internationally famous women..." (From "The Face: An Obsession").  Stein resides in New York City.</p>
