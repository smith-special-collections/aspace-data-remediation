     <p>The Townsend-O'Brien-Hoffheimer Family Papers include material from Charlotte Townsend (?-1926); Margaret Townsend O'Brien (1889-1961); Charlotte Townsend O'Brien Hoffheimer (1919-1991); and Margaret Townsend O'Brien II (1917-  ). Of these three generations of women, two generations were Smith students.  After their Smith graduations Margaret Townsend O'Brien II earned a Ph.D. from Harvard and taught languages and  Charlotte Townsend O'Brien Hoffheimer served as a WAC officer in World War II, deciphering Japanese code.  The collection also includes two generations of naturalists and two  interfaith marriages (Margaret Townsend O'Brien married an Irish Catholic and Charlotte Townsend O'Brien Hoffheimer  married a Jewish man). Charlotte Townsend O'Brien Hoffheimer volunteered for numerous social and civil organizations.</p>

     <p>The Townsend-O'Brien-Hoffheimer Family Collection consists primarily of correspondence between these three generations of women and other family.  Two-thirds of the collection consists of  letters from Margaret O'Brien Townsend (I) and  the remaining third is composed of letters from her daughter, Charlotte Townsend O'Brien. There are letters from Smith College and some diaries are also document Smith years for both mother and daughter.  Margaret Townsend O'Brien's I's letters discuss daily boarding school life and close relationships with female classmates.  Other subjects discussed include Margaret Townsend O'Brien's bout with serious illness when she was young; Margaret II's career as a professor of languages; and Charlotte Townsend O'Brien Hoffheimer's army experiences. The letters are rich in detail about personal development, family life, and similar subjects.   Charlotte Townsend O'Brien suggested that "her greatest historical accomplishment, like her mother's, was probably the private transmission of a cultured, reverent view of nature to the younger generation." </p>
