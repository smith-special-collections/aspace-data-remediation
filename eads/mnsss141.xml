         <p>(Laura) Jane Addams was born on 6 September 1860 in
    Cedarville, Illinois. She was the youngest of five children
    of John Huy Addams and Sarah Weber Addams. Her father was a
    prosperous mill owner and a leader in state politics; he
    served for sixteen years as an Illinois state senator. Her
    mother died when Addams was only two years old. Her father
    married Anna H. Haldeman in 1865, which added two
    stepbrothers to the family. Jane Addams was profoundly
    influenced by her father. He encouraged her education and
    ambition; however, when she set her heart on attending Smith
    College, he refused to send her so far away from home. In
    1877, she entered Rockford Female Seminary in nearby
    Rockford, Illinois. In 1881, Addams was the valedictorian of
    her graduating class. One year later she received a
    bachelor's degree when the school became the Rockford College
    for Women.</p>
         <p>Addams planned to study medicine and become a doctor. In
    1881, she began her schooling at the Women's Medical College
    of Pennsylvania. Her father's sudden death and her own ill
    health forced Addams to abandon her medical studies. In 1882,
    she had surgery to remedy a congenital spinal defect. Addams,
    accompanied by her stepmother, traveled in Europe from 1883
    until 1885. In London's East end she observed urban poverty
    first hand; this exposure left a lasting impression on
    Addams. In 1887, Addams returned to Europe with Ellen Gates
    Starr, a Rockford classmate. On this trip, which included a
    visit to Toynbee Hall, a settlement house in London's East
    End, Addams and Starr formulated ideas about establishing a
    settlement house in the U.S. that would directly address the
    human consequences of rapid industrialization, immigration,
    and urban poverty.</p>
         <p>After their return to the United States in 1899, Addams
    and Starr leased a dilapidated mansion in one of the poorest
    immigrant slums of Chicago on the corner of Halstead and Polk
    streets. Hull House, which was named after the original
    owner, was the first settlement house in America. Its mission
    was to "investigate and improve the conditions in the
    industrial districts of Chicago" and function as a center of
    civic and social life in a neighborhood that consisted of
    multiple immigrant groups. It was both an educational and a
    philanthropic activity. Addams, Starr, and other activists
    and reformers who resided at Hull House learned first-hand
    the needs of a diverse urban community. Hull House residents
    raised money; found volunteers, especially among the growing
    number of female college students and graduates; helped sick
    children, displaced families, and the unemployed; taught
    vocational and educational classes; and offered their support
    to Chicago's working people. Hull House provided numerous
    activities and services including: health and child care,
    clubs for both children and adults, an art gallery, kitchen,
    gymnasium, music school, theater, library, employment bureau,
    and a labor museum.</p>
         <p>Through her work at Hull House, Addams became heavily
    involved with civic affairs of Chicago and was a leader in
    the social reform movement. She fought for legislation
    regarding housing, sanitation, factory inspection, and
    immigrant rights. She also effectively campaigned for child
    labor laws and other protective legislation. Addams became
    strongly allied with the labor movement and allowed union
    organizing meetings to be held at Hull House. In 1910, she
    arbitrated a garment strike involving 90,000 workers. That
    year she also became Vice President of the American Branch of
    International Association for Labor Legislation. Addams was a
    feminist and supported the women's suffrage campaign. She
    served as Vice President of the National American Woman
    Suffrage Association (1911-14). She was also active in the
    Progressive Party and especially supported its platform for
    industrial safety.</p>
         <p>Hull House brought Jane Addams world-wide celebrity, and
    she was recognized as a pioneer in the field of social work.
    However, with the onset of war in Europe in the 1910s, public
    opinion turned against Addams as she became increasingly
    active in the pacifist and internationalist movements. In
    1915, Addams co-founded the Women's Peace Party (WPP). Addams
    and the WPP established strong networks of peace activists in
    the U.S. and abroad, and in 1919, the WPP evolved into the
    Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, a
    still-thriving organization that "works to achieve through
    peaceful means world disarmament, full rights for women,
    racial and economic justice, an end to all forms of violence,
    and to establish those political, social, and psychological
    conditions which can assure peace, freedom, and justice for
    all." Jane Addams served as the first president of WILPF
    (1919-1929). In 1931, Addams was awarded the Nobel Peace
    Prize for her pacifist activism. She was the first American
    woman to receive this honor.</p>
         <p>Addams wrote prodigiously throughout her life, and the
    profits from her books were her main source of income. Some
    of her notable works are Newer Ideals of Peace (1907), Twenty
    Years at Hull House (1910), The Long Road of Women's Memory
    (1916), Peace and Bread in Time of War (1922), and The Second
    Twenty Years at Hull House (1930). She received honorary
    degrees from numerous colleges and universities including:
    Wisconsin, Smith, Yale, Tufts, Northwestern, Chicago, and
    Bryn Mawr. Among her many other achievements and commitments,
    Jane Addams was a founding member of the NAACP (1909) and the
    ACLU (1920). She died of cancer in 1935, and she was buried
    at her childhood home in Cedarville, Illinois.</p>

         <p>The Jane Addams papers consist of 1.5 linear feet of
    material. They contain primarily duplicates from the
    Swarthmore Peace Collection. There is some biographical
    information including articles (1898-1961), obituaries
    (1935), memorials (1935-60), and typescripts of radio
    broadcasts about her (1932-40). Organizational and historical
    information about the Women's International League for Peace
    and Freedom is included in the memorials section. There are
    typescripts of speeches by Addams (1912-33), which provide
    her perspective on topics including social service, women's
    issues, and World War I. Many reprints of articles
    (1898-1935) by Addams also offer insight as to her opinion on
    a variety of subjects. Some topics addressed in this section
    are: nationalism, peace, politics, labor, suffrage, women's
    rights, WWI, and social work.</p>
         <p>There are some articles and printed material regarding
    Hull House (1897-1950), and a few photographs and pictures of
    Addams and Hull House. A small amount of correspondence
    consists of a few original autographed letters to friends
    (1903-1934).</p>
         <p>The Jane Addams Papers are closely related to the <extref href="mnsss64_main.html">Ellen
        Gates Starr Papers</extref> in the Sophia Smith Collection.
    Researchers may wish also to consult the Peace and Settlement
    House Collections for further information about the Women's
    International League for Peace and Freedom and Hull House, as
    well as the Schwimmer-Lloyd and Madeleine Zabriskie Doty
    Papers (re: WILPF) and the Jessie Lloyd O'Connor Papers
    (O'Connor was a resident/worker at Hull House).</p>
