     <p>Founded in 1987 as "a group of low-income women and their allies who organize and educate
around poverty, welfare and low-income survival issues. [They] offer training in writing, speaking,
advocacy, computer skills, desktop publishing, organizing, membership and leadership. With these
skills [they] are able to provide a forum for the voices of low-income women to be heard. [They]
connect welfare office outreach and campus organizing with local and broader grassroots efforts to
eliminate social and economic injustice" [from 
<extref href="http://survivorsinc.org/">Survivors, Inc. Web site</extref>] Inspired
by Professor Ann Withorn's History of Poverty course within the College of Public and Community
Service at UMass Boston, original founders included returning students and AFDC recipients Dottie
Stevens and Diane Dujon. Reflecting the cross-class nature of Survivors, Inc., Claire Cummings, a
professor of sociology and women's studies at Newbury College, and Betty Reid Mandell, a professor
of social work at Bridgewater State College, were also founders.  Stevens, Dujon and other students
also co-founded ARMS (Advocacy for Resources for Modern Survival!) in 1987, a UMass Boston student
organization aimed at students who were or had been welfare recipients. Stevens then served as the
first director of ARMS while also serving as president of the Coalition for Basic Human Needs
(CBHN).  Stevens and Dujon were also among the founders of the Mass. Welfare Rights Union.
Eventually during the 1990s, Survivors, Inc. supplanted CBHN, and to this day remains active in the
Boston area, publishing twice a year <title render="italic">Survival News</title>.</p>
