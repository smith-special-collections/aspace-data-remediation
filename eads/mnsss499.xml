       <p> Agnes Louise Cosgrove Thénaud Lauga was born  February 6, 1911 to Elizabeth and John
   Cosgrove in Providence, RI.  She earned her Bachelor's degree from Pembroke College, Brown
   University (1932), her Master's degree from Brown University (1937);  and her MSW from the Smith
   College School for Social Work in 1944.  From 1944 to 1947, she worked at Family Service in
   Cincinnati, Ohio, and went on to work at the Central Clinic of the University of Cincinnati
   School of Medicine, from 1947 to 1955.  She was recruited as Director of Psychiatric Social Work
   at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, where she worked from 1955 to 1970, to forge the
   college's newly-established psychiatric social service program; she then served as Associate
   Director and Acting Director of Social Work.  Lauga also held faculty appointments at the
   University of Cincinnati and Yeshiva University.  As an alumna, she was deeply involved in the
   Smith College School for Social Work, serving on its Governance Board, on search committees, and
   in key positions in the Alumnae Association, including President and Chair of the Annual Fund.
   Lauga wrote extensively, taught at workshops and institutes, and served on panels of major
   professional associations.  In 1985, She received the Smith College School for Social Work's Day-
   Garrett Award.  Agnes married Franc Thénaud in 1937.  He died while serving as a translator at
   the Nuremberg Trials.  She later married Henri Lauga and they lived in New York.  She died in
   2007.</p>
