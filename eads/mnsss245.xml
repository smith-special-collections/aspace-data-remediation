       <p>Annette Hoyt Flanders was born in Milwaukee, WI, the daughter of Frank M. Hoyt, a
prominent attorney, and Hettie Pamelia Hoyt.  She received her early education from tutors
and at private schools.  She majored in botany at Smith College, earning her B.S. in 1918,
and received her M.A. in landscape architecture from the University of Illinois.  She
studied civil engineering at Marquette University, as well as design, architecture and the
history of architecture at the Sorbonne.  She served with the American Red Cross in France
in 1918 and 1919.  Upon her return, she joined the landscape architecture firm of Vitale,
Brinckerhoff, and Geiffert in New York, where she was responsible for design and for
supervising planting.  She opened her own office in 1922.  The scope of her practice was
extensive, and included private estates, real estate subdivisions, the grounds of industrial
plants, recreational developments, and exhibit gardens throughout the United States.
Flanders became a member of the American Society of Landscape Architects in 1923, and was
elected a Fellow in 1942.  In 1932, she was awarded the Medal of Honor in Landscape
Architecture of the Architectural League of New York.  She relocated her office to Milwaukee
in 1943.  Flanders lectured extensively to horticultural and botanical societies, schools,
and garden and women's clubs, and also appeared often on radio talk shows.  She wrote
extensively for numerous publications, including <title render="italic">House and Garden</title>, <title render="italic">Country Life in America</title>,
and <title render="italic">House Beautiful</title>.</p>
