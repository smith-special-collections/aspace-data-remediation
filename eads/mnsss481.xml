   	 <p>Belle Kaufman was born in Berlin, Germany on 11 May 1911. She was the daughter of Lala Rabiniwitz and Michael Kaufman, and  she the granddaughter of famed Yiddish writer Sholom Aleichem, on whose stories Fiddler on the Roof is based. Kaufman was raised in Odessa and Moscow before emigrating the the U.S. in  1924 at age twelve. Despite knowing no English when she came to the U.S., she graduated from  South Side High School (Newark, New Jersey) in 1929, and went on to earn her B.A. magna cum  laude from Hunter College (1934), her M.A. from Columbia University in 1936. Kaufman maried Sydney Goldstine in 1940 and they two children, Jonathan Goldstine and Thea Goldstine; the  couple later divorced. She taught high school English for many years, was assistant profesor of  English at the City University of New York and lecturer at the New School for Social Research, and has taught creative writing seminars and workshops at the University of Florida and the University of Rochester and other institutions. In the 1940s, she changed the spelling of her first name to the more androgynous first name Bel in order to sell a story to <title render="italic">Esquire </title>magazine.</p>

	 <p>Kaufman is best known as the author of <title render="italic">Up the Down Staircase</title> (1964), a novel based on her experiences as a New York City high school teacher, which was made into a play and a movie starring Sandy Dennis in 1967. First published by Prentice Hall, her book spent more than a year on the <title render="italic">New York Times</title> best-seller list, has sold more than six million copies, been translated into at least 16 languages, and is in its fifty-seventh printing. Kaufman is also the author of <title render="italic">Love, Etc.</title> (1979), a novel about coping with the  breakup of a marriage, and of many short stories. Kaufman has been a highly sought-after public speaker at education conventions and Jewish organizations throughout the country, and won  many honors and awards, including honorary degrees from several colleges and universities. Bel Kaufman died at the age of 103 on July 25, 2014 at her home in Manhattan.</p>
