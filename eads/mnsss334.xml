      <abstract encodinganalog="520$a" label="Abstract:">Patriotic and genealogical organization. Records of the New York City Colony of NSNEW include correspondence, minutes, genealogical records, membership applications, scrapbooks, and memorabilia dating from its founding in 1895.  They document the early history of the society before it became a national organization in 1913, and the colony business after that, including its genealogical, social and philanthropic activities.

       <p>The National Society of New England Women was founded 1895 at the New York City home of Mrs. William Gerry Slade. When the society was reorganized in 1913 to become a national organization, the founding group in New York City became one of the colonies of the national organization, the New York City Colony.

<scopecontent id="scope">
      
       <p>The records of the New York City Colony of NSNEW document the early history of the society before it became a national organization. After 1913, they document colony business only, including that of the national organization which pertains to the colony. They consist of correspondence, minutes, genealogical records, membership applications, scrapbooks, and memorabilia dating from its founding in 1895. In addition to the early history of the society and the history of the colony, the records also reflect the general goals and activities of patriotic societies in the United States, many of which were founded during the same period in American history. The membership of the society mirrors its beliefs and, in its fluctuating size, the patriotic inclinations of the entire country. This portion of the United States' population may also be studied for its genealogical origins and ongoing social and philanthropic activities.</p>
