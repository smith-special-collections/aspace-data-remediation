         <abstract encodinganalog="520$a" label="Abstract:">The Garrison Family Papers contain thousands of primary sources that document the family's involvement in politics, business, art, literature, religion, education, and most of the major reform movements of the 19th and early 20th centuries. These include abolition, anti-imperialism, anti-vaccination, conservation, free trade and tariff reform, immigration reform, pacifism, race, single tax, and temperance. Extensive correspondence, diaries, clippings, articles, speeches, photographs, memorabilia, and a wide variety of printed sources trace the activities of the Garrison, Coffin, Mott, and Wright families and their friends and associates in England, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and New York, among other places.  Although there are letters and other documents relating to abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison (1805-1879), the largest part of the material relates to his son, William Lloyd Garrison (1838-1909), Ellen Wright Garrison, and their descendents.

         <p><title render="bold">The Garrison Family</title></p>
         <p> Generation 1: Abijah Garrison and Frances ("Fanny") Lloyd Garrison </p>
         <p> The Garrison Family Papers begin with Abijah Garrison (1773 -  ?) and Frances ("Fanny") Lloyd Garrison (1776-1823). Abijah was born in an isolated farming community in New Brunswick, Canada. By the 1790s he had become a seaman based in St. John. He married Frances Lloyd in 1798 and they settled on the Jemseg River in New Brunswick. They moved to St. John in 1801.  They had two daughters (Mary Ann and Caroline Eliza) and a son (James Holley). Mary Ann died in infancy and in 1805 the family moved to Newburyport,  Massachusetts. In December of that year a fourth child, William Lloyd, was born, followed by Elizabeth Knowlton in 1808. A man of intemperate habits, Abijah abandoned his wife and family shortly after Elizabeth's birth. He was never heard from again. </p>
         <p> Generation 2: William Lloyd Garrison and Helen Benson Garrison </p>
         <p> Frances Lloyd Garrison, abandoned with small children to care for, placed her son William Lloyd (1805-1879) (see DAB) in the care of Deacon Ezekiel Bartlett. He received little schooling, and was apprenticed in 1818 to Ephraim Allen of the Newburyport <title render="italic">Herald</title>. In 1826 he became editor of the <title render="italic">Free Press</title>. When the press failed he became a journeyman printer and in 1828 he joined with Nathaniel White in editing the temperance newspaper <title render="italic">National Philanthropist</title>. Influenced by Benjamin Lundy, a Quaker, he became interested in the abolition movement, a cause he championed for the next thirty years. He founded the abolitionist newspaper, <title render="italic">The Liberator</title>, in 1831 which he published until 1865. In 1834 he married Helen Benson, daughter of a retired merchant and member of an abolitionist family. They had seven children: George Thompson (1836-1904) , William Lloyd (1838-1909), Wendell Phillips (1840-1907), Charles Follen (1842-1849), Helen Frances ("Fanny") (1844-1928) , Elizabeth Pease (1846-1848), and Francis Jackson (1848-1916).  Although there are papers generated by all of the surviving children, those of William Lloyd are most complete.</p>
         <p> Generation 3: Children of William Lloyd Garrison and Helen Benson Garrison </p>
         <p> There are seven descendents in Generation 3 of the Garrison family. All of the children of William Lloyd and Helen Benson Garrison, with the exception of George, followed in their father's reform footsteps. Wendell, via his editorship at <title render="italic">The Nation</title>, was involved in abolition, freedman's relief, and  racial and sexual equality. Fanny, following the death of her husband, Henry Villard, became involved in the suffrage movement and pacifism. Francis in addition to his  position as editor at Houghton Mifflin, championed racial and sexual equality. A detailed description of  all  of the children  in Generation 3 can be found in Harriet Alonso's <title render="italic">Growing Up Abolitionist, the Story of the Garrison Children</title>.  The primary persons in this generation represented in the Papers are William Lloyd Garrison and Ellen Wright Garrison.</p>
         <p> William Lloyd Garrison left school at the age of eighteen to begin a business career. In 1855 he became associated with abolitionist James Buffum and lived with the Buffum family for seven years where he became involved in various reform movements. He held  clerical and banking positions and in 1864 he went into the wool business. In addition, he established one of the earliest electric light stations in Brockton, Massachusetts, and also dealt in bonds, retiring from business in 1902. He was, however, a reformer at heart and up until his death in 1909 was involved in abolition, women's rights and suffrage, immigration reform, Armenian and Russian relief, Irish home rule, anti-imperialism, pacifism, temperance, and free trade. He was also an avid single taxer and president of the Massachusetts Single Tax league. In 1864 he married Ellen Wright, daughter of Martha Coffin and David Wright (See Wright Family).</p>
         <p> Ellen Wright was born in 1842 and grew up in a Quaker abolitionist community. She was educated at  abolitionist Theodore Weld's Eagleswood School in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, Sharon Female Seminary in Darby, Pennsylvania, and Mrs. Sedgwick's Young Ladies School in Lenox, Massachusetts.  Influenced by her mother's activism, a life long friendship with Susan B. Anthony, and the reform movements of her husband, Ellen was an active life member in the National American Woman Suffrage Association.</p>
         <p> Generation 4: Children of William Lloyd Garrison and Ellen Wright Garrison </p>
         <p> There are eighteen descendents in Generation 4 of the Garrison family. William Lloyd and Ellen had five children: Agnes (1866-1950), Charles (1868-1951), Frank Wright (1871-1961), William Lloyd (1874-1964), and Eleanor (1880-1974).  Although there is material on all of the children as well as other family members, William, Eleanor and Agnes are the most well represented in these papers.</p>
         <p> William graduated from Harvard in 1897 and attended Harvard Law School. He became an investment banker and  in 1908 became a partner in the firm of Perry, Coffin &amp; Burr. When that partnership was dissolved, he became president of a new firm of Coffin &amp; Burr. According to family members, in hard times he was known to have reimbursed clients from his own pocket if they lost money from his investments. He retired in 1933. A reformer at heart his causes included anti-vaccination, anti-imperialism, free trade, pacifism and racial and sexual equality.  In 1901 he married Edith Alice Stephenson  (see also Stephenson Family).</p>
         <p> Edith was born in  1878, the third of  seven  children of Benjamin Turner and Luda Grant Stephenson. She was trained as a concert pianist. In addition to raising their six children, she was active in the suffrage movement and was president of the Newton Equal Suffrage League.</p>
         <p> Eleanor graduated from Smith College in 1904 and received a Master of Arts degree from Radcliffe in 1906. When she graduated, the suffrage movement was at its peak and she worked avidly for the vote until 1919. In 1912 she became an organizer  for Carrie Chapman Catt who headed the New York State campaign for women's suffrage headquartered in New York City. When the campaign ended she became interested in photography which she worked at for 10 years. In the 1940s she moved to California to care for her sister Agnes, remaining there with her brother Frank after Agnes' death.</p>
         <p> Generation 5: The children of William Lloyd Garrison and Edith Stephenson Garrison </p>
         <p> There are twenty-nine descendents in Generation 5 of the Garrison family. The papers primarily concern the children of William Lloyd and Edith Stephenson: William Lloyd (1902-1988 ) Claire ("Tita") (1903-1985), David Lloyd (1906- 2001), John Bright (1909-1988) Faith (1910- 1981) and Edith Lloyd ("Yoy") (1913-1993). The largest portion of the papers concern David.</p>
         <p> David Lloyd Garrison graduated from Harvard in 1928 with a degree in fine arts. He taught for several years and then joined J.H. Emerson Co., manufacturers of breathing equipment. He was an avid birder, and just prior to World War II he was curator of birds at New England Museum of Natural History and the editor of the <title render="italic">Bulletin of New England Bird Life</title>. He published a number of papers on birds. He relinquished his conscientious objector status and served as a non-combatant medical technician during World War II. He married Alice ("Pat) O'Reilly (his superior officer) in 1945. After the war he resumed his work for the J. H. Emerson Company. He was also an amateur artist and was active in peace activism, land conservation and civic and church affairs.</p>
         <p> The papers do not go beyond Generation 5 of the Garrison family, but there are 60 Garrison descendents in Generation 6.</p>

         <p><title render="bold">The Wright family</title></p>
         <p> There are four generations of the Wright family represent in the Garrison family papers. Material in these papers primarily represent Martha Coffin Wright, Lucretia Coffin Mott, Marianna Pelham Mott, and Eliza Wright Osborne. </p>
         <p> Martha Coffin Wright (see NAW) was the eighth child of Thomas Coffin and Anna Folger Coffin. She was born in 1806 and in 1824, after three years of boarding school, she married army captain Peter Pelham. They had a daughter Marianna. Pelham died in 1826. In 1829 Martha married lawyer David Wright with whom she had six children: Eliza (1830), Matthew Tallman (1832), Ellen (1840), William Pelham (1842), Frank (1844), and Charles (1848). In 1848 she joined with her sister Lucretia Coffin Mott, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Jane Hunt, and Mary Ann McClintock  in planning the first woman's right convention at Seneca Falls, New York. She continued to be active throughout her life in the cause for women's rights and suffrage. She was elected to the presidency of the National Woman Suffrage Association in 1874.</p>
         <p> Lucretia Coffin Mott  (see NAW) was the second child of Thomas Coffin and Anna Folger Coffin. Born in 1793 on Nantucket, Massachusetts, in a Quaker household, she was educated in a Friends boarding school near Poughkeepsie, New York, where she later taught. In 1811 she married James Mott, a fellow teacher, who shared her causes and feminist leanings. She was an avid abolitionist and pacifist, and along with her sister Martha Coffin Wright, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Jane Hunt, and Mary Ann McClintock, planned the first woman's right convention at Seneca Falls, New York. She was president of the American Equal Rights Association from 1866 until the organization split into the National American Woman Suffrage Association and the American Woman Suffrage Association in 1869.  The Motts had five children: Anna, Maria, Thomas, Elizabeth, and Martha. Thomas Mott married Marianna Pelham, the eldest daughter of Martha Coffin Wright.</p>
         <p> Marianna Pelham was the daughter of Martha Coffin Wright by her first husband, Peter Pelham. In 1845 she married her cousin, Thomas Mott, son of Lucretia Coffin Mott and James Mott. They had three children: Isabel (1846), Emily (1848) and Maria (1853). </p>
         <p> Eliza was the eldest of six children of Martha Coffin and David Wright. In 1851 she married David Munson Osborne. They had four children, Florence (1856), Emily (1853), Thomas Mott (1859) and Helen (1884).</p>

        <p><title render="bold">Stephenson Family</title></p>
         <p> There are five generations of the Stephenson family represented in the Garrison Family Papers.  The first generation includes Bryant Parrot  (1784-1841) and Abigail Gilbert Balkam (1784-1857) Stephenson. There is further documentation of the subsequent generations up to the nieces and nephews of Edith Stephenson Garrison. Edith's papers are included with the Garrison Family, and the Stephensons are primarily represented by Benjamin Turner and Lucinda (Luda) Grant Stephenson, the parents of Edith Alice Stephenson.</p>
      </bioghist>
      <scopecontent id="scope">
         
         <p> The Garrison Family Papers consist of 117.75 linear feet of material and contain thousands of primary sources that document three families' involvement in most of the major reform movements of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The collection spans the years 1694 to 2005, but the bulk of the material dates from 1830 to 1950.  Types of material include correspondence, diaries, writings, speeches, legal documents, photographs, journal and newspaper articles, memorabilia, and a wide variety of printed sources.</p>
         <p> Included are the papers of two families who married into the Garrisons: the Wrights (Ellen Wright married William Lloyd Garrison (1838-1909)) and the Stephensons (Edith Stephenson married William Lloyd Garrison (1874 -1964)). The Wright family includes the Coffins (Ellen's mother was Martha Coffin Wright) and the Mott family (Ellen's aunt, Martha's elder sister, was Lucretia Coffin Mott) and their descendents. These papers trace the activities of the Garrison, Wright and Stephenson families and their friends and associates in England, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and New York, among other places.</p>
         <p> Although there is unique correspondence, biographical material, printed material, and memorabilia related to William Lloyd Garrison (1805-1879), the largest part of the collection relates to his son William Lloyd Garrison (1838-1909) and WLG's (1838-1909) wife, Ellen Wright Garrison, and their descendents. The influence of patriarch William Lloyd Garrison (1805) can be seen as each generation took its place in the reform movements of its time. These include abolition, anti-imperialism, anti-vaccination, conservation, free trade and tariff reform, immigration reform, pacifism, race, single tax, and temperance. The papers are an especially important source for the suffrage and women's rights movements because they include the correspondence of Martha Coffin Wright and Lucretia Coffin Mott with other leaders of the movement; as well as correspondence, printed material and ephemera of Eleanor Garrison, who was an organizer for the Empire State suffrage campaign under Carrie Chapman Catt.  Major correspondents on abolition, women's rights, and other reforms include Susan B. Anthony, Alice Stone Blackwell, Henry B. Blackwell, Carrie Chapman Catt, Lucy Conant,  Matilda Joslyn   Gage, Henry George, Lucretia Coffin Mott, Emmeline and Sylvia Pankhurst, Theodore Parker, Wendell Phillips, Parker Pillsbury, Louis Prang, Caroline Severance, Anna Howard Shaw, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucy Stone, Booker T. Washington, Theodore Dwight Weld, Frances E. Willard, and Marie Zakrzewska.</p>
         <p> Because the Garrisons were a close-knit family, in addition to a wide view of reform, the papers offer a look at  two centuries of intimate family life, inter-generational dynamics, and social history. There is extensive correspondence between parents and children, siblings, husbands and wives, cousins, aunts and uncles.  They also had a wide circle of friends and associates and an extensive social network, especially in and around Boston.</p>
         <p> For the purposes of this project, Garrison family members have been defined as original Garrisons and their direct descendants and anyone who married into the family. In order to differentiate between the various William Lloyd Garrisons, they have been identified by initials and birth dates: i.e. WLG (1805); WLG(1838); WLG (1874), and WLG(1902). It is not always clear which WLG some of the material relates to. The same holds true for the three generations which contain a Benjamin Turner Stephenson in the Stephenson family. Married women are located under their married names.</p>
         <p> Since the Garrisons and Wrights were involved in so many reform movements, their letters are full of references to noted people and related activities. Although incomplete, there are two ways this information can be accessed. One is via the card catalog in the Sophia Smith Collection, a second via letter indexes.  Approximately one-half of the Garrison Family Papers were indexed by subject for inclusion in the card catalog. Although the box numbers are now outdated, the information contained on the cards is a valuable tool. Over the years, family members, especially Frank Wright Garrison, indexed large portions of the Garrison and Wright family correspondence. These indexes are filed separately at the end of the collection. They are arranged by author and then somewhat randomly by date and consist of detailed notations on the contents of each letter.  Although they are somewhat difficult to use, these indexes represent an extraordinary body of information.</p>

               <p>The Garrison Family Papers were donated to the Sophia Smith Collection by Eleanor Garrison (Smith 1904) beginning in 1948, and continued by Frank Wright Garrison. The major growth of the collection can be traced in the Friends of the Smith College Library Reports, 1948-1965. Since then additional donations were made by various friends and family members: Mrs. Hendon Chubb, James Gould, Lucretia Wells, Otelia Cromwell, Lucia Norton Valentine, Edna Stantial, Agnes Garrison, and William Lloyd and Edith Stephenson Garrison.  The most recent  donation was made in 2001 and 2002 by Edith Garrison Griffin.

		<p>This material is divided into four subseries: Papers, Genealogy, Garrison Family and Friends and associates.</p> 

		<p>The first subseries consists of correspondence, articles, and inventories regarding Garrison Papers located in other repositories. They are arranged alphabetically by repository. </p>

		<p>The Genealogy subseries contains Garrison Family genealogical research and correspondence. Genealogical material related to the Wright Family and Stephenson Family is contained in SERIES X and XI respectively. It includes James Gould's research material gathered while compiling the family trees, Frank Wright Garrison's notes, and the notes and correspondence compiled by Wendell Phillips Garrison in 1884 while attempting to trace the family's early history in New Brunswick, Canada.</p>

		<p>The third subseries, containing information on fifty-two Garrisons, is arranged alphabetically by person and consists of clippings, pamphlets, datebooks, legal records (wills, birth and marriage certificates), tributes, memorials, biographies, commemorative poems, letters of recommendation, and related correspondence.  The largest groups of material relate to WLG (1805) and WLG (1838). Of particular interest are various biographies of WLG (1805), including a hand written memoir written by his son, WLG (1838); documents related to the Francis Todd libel suit brought against Garrison and Benjamin Lundy in 1830; and documents related to an incident in 1835 when WLG (1805) barely escaped lynching by a mob in Boston. There is a handwritten autobiographical reminiscence of WLG (1838) dictated to his daughter Agnes in 1909 and correspondence related to his railroad accident in 1871.</p>

		<p>The fourth subseries, Friends and associates, consists of the same type of materials as subseries three with the addition of published writings and memorabilia. This subseries contains information on many noted people. Although most of the material included here concerns friends of the Garrisons, there is also information about others that that the family collected. They include Susan B. Anthony; Alice Stone Blackwell; Josephine Butler; Frederick Douglass; Henry George; Thomas Wentworth Higginson; the May, McKim, and Pankhurst families; Harriet Martineau; Theodore Parker; Wendell Phillips; Parker Pillsbury; Joseph Lindon Smith (including drawings and sketches); Harriet Tubman; Booker T. Washington; Theodore Dwight Weld; and Marie Zakrzewska. The McKim family includes an autobiographical dairy (1831-36) by James Miller McKim, a cookbook (1831) belonging to Sarah Speakman McKim, and documents related to her separation from the Society of Friends for  marrying outside the Society (1840). Also of interest is an 1872 sea diary of Charles Daniel. </p>

		<p>This series contains narrative and line-a-day diaries and date books for eleven Garrisons: Agnes (1879-1945), David Lloyd (1950-95), Edith Stephenson (1907-63), Eleanor (1913-15), Ellen Wright (1854-1915), Frank Wright and Mildred Yarnall (1886-1961), Robert Hale (1913-14, 1959), Wendell Phillips (1860-68), WLG (1838) (1856-1909), and WLG (1874) (1896-97).  It is arranged alphabetically. Diaries of Agnes and Ellen Wright Garrison have been microfilmed for History of Women (Research  Publications, 1983).</p>
		<p>Agnes' diaries are of interest because they cover a long period. The earlier ones are more complete than the later and some contain entries in shorthand. She began these in 1879 at the age 13. They are relatively detailed and reveal the social and cultural world of  late nineteenth century girlhood. There are travel diaries from the late 1880s. </p>
		<p>David was also an avid diarist. Although the series we have consist of notes and an index rather than narratives, in his later years he rewrote them in narrative form. These will be given to the Sophia Smith Collection in the future. </p>
		<p>Ellen Wright Garrison's diaries are most complete for her girlhood and are a valuable record of  the education and maturation of a young woman, daughter of abolitionists and women's rights advocates just prior to and during the Civil War. </p>
		<p>The diaries of Frank and Mildred Yarnall Garrison are combined because both contributed to the writing. In addition there is an early typed copy of a diary of Mildred's from 1886. </p>
		<p>There is a long run of WLG (1838)'s diaries.  Although they are brief-entry diaries they are a good source for information about his activities and contacts. The diary for 1901 contains a necrology of abolitionists. Volumes dating from 1897 to 1909 are boxed separately because of their size. </p>

	<p>This series is divided into three subseries: Family letters,  Letters to the Garrisons, and Third party correspondence. Letters by and to the Wrights and Stephensons are located in SERIES X and XI respectively. Some letters in this series, especially those from Generation 1 have been photocopied for preservation purposes. </p>
		<p>Correspondence related to specific subjects (i.e. free trade, suffrage, single tax, Wianno etc.) is located in SERIES VI. SUBJECT FILES, although  these subjects are included in the family's personal correspondence as well. Financial and business correspondence is located in SERIES V. FINANCIAL MATERIALS, but the relationship is also fluid because WLG (1874) handled business affairs for  many family members and friends.</p>
		<p><title render="bold">Family letters</title></p>

		<p>The first subseries is arranged by generation and then alphabetically by author.  If there are only a few letters they have been filed together and arranged by date, otherwise they have been arranged alphabetically by recipient. In some cases where there are many letters from and to couples, the husband's and wive's letters are combined. There are some letters grouped by subject, i.e., suffrage letters and letters home from travelers.  It should be noted that some letters are authored and/or addressed to more than one person and sometimes letters are written on the backs of others. There are five  generations represented: from the parents of WLG (1805) (Generation 1) to that of WLG (1902) (Generation 5). The one exception from Generation 6, letters from James and Anne Gould, is included  because Gould has done extensive genealogical work on the Garrison Family and is the compiler of Garrison family trees. </p>

		<p><title render="italic">Generation 1</title> </p>

		<p>This section contains thirty-nine original letters authored by Abijah Garrison, Frances ("Fanny") Lloyd Garrison, and Abijah's brother, William. These consist of  one letter from Abijah to his parents, Joseph and Mary Garrison (1805), two to his wife Frances (1804, 1806), one to his brother Joseph (1806), one to his cousin Johanna Palmer (1814), and one to  "Jones" (1798).  
</p>
		<p>Fanny's letters consist of  thirteen to her son William (1814-22), one to her daughter Maria (1821) and one to her son James (1818). There is one to Ephraim Allen (1823), to whom her son was apprenticed, and one to "friends" (1807). In addition there are twelve letters to her friend Martha Farnham with whom she left her daughter, Maria Elizabeth. Included with these is a "log" of an ocean voyage from Salem to Baltimore probably intended for Martha.</p>
		<p>Finally there are two letters from William Garrison, one to his brother Abijah (1806) another to his nephew Andrew (1832).</p>
		<p><title render="italic">Generation 2</title></p>
		<p>There are six Garrisons represented in Generation 2. Of particular interest are Helen Benson Garrison's letters to her brother George (1848), her daughter-in-law Ellen Wright Garrison (1865-73) and her children: Wendell (1856-74), William (1855-72), and Fanny (1866). There are letters in this section from WLG (1805) to his mother (1843), his wife, Helen (1846, 1870-71), daughter-in-law Ellen (1864-78), and his children: Fanny (1871-78), George (1876-78), Wendell and his wife Lucy McKim (1858-78), and William (1855-78). In addition there are letters to his brother in law, George Benson (1843) and other friends and abolitionists including James Buffum (1855), Samuel May (1851), James Miller McKim (1853), Lucretia and Thomas Mott (1840, 1868), and Edmund Quincy (1840-77). Of particular interest is a copy of a letter from WLG (1805) to Harriet Farnham Horton written from jail in 1830.</p>
		<p>In addition there are seven letters (1843-80) from W. A. Garrison to WLG (1805) and Wendell Phillips Garrison. W.A. Garrison is most likely the son of Abijah's brother Joseph.</p> 
		<p><title render="italic">Generation 3</title></p>
		<p>There are ten Garrisons represented in Generation 3: Annie McKim Dennis Garrison, Francis Jackson and Theresa Holmes Garrison, George Thompson Garrison, Wendell Phillips and Lucy McKim Garrison,  WLG (1838) and Ellen Wright Garrison, Fanny Garrison Villard and Henry Villard. As with other generations this correspondence emphasizes the closeness among the Garrison siblings and with their extended family and friends.  This generation's correspondence includes courtship letters between WLG (1838) and Ellen Wright, and Lucy McKim and Wendell Garrison; and travel and suffrage correspondence. There is also correspondence between Ellen Wright and Lucy McKim (1852-77), girlhood friends before they both became "Garrisons." These letters discuss their experiences at Eagleswood School, life during the Civil War years, especially from the perspective of  the abolitionist circle of connections; and their courtships and marriages. </p>

		<p>Ellen's letters to Susan B. Anthony (1858-82), letters to her family about her suffrage activities (1898-1904), and from her travels (1901-06) are also noteworthy. The letters to Susan reflect a close personal bond. There is a particularly long run of letters to her sister-in law, Agnes (1876-1930). The letters to her parents (1853-97) and her siblings (1853-1911) describe her girlhood (especially her letters from school), her married life, and her women's right activities. Her letters to WLG (1838) (1863-1930) include courtship letters (1863-64). </p>

		<p>George Thomson Garrison's letters to his family (1853-89), especially to his mother and brothers William and Wendell, detail his Civil War experiences and his struggle to find personal and professional independence apart from his family. </p> 

		<p>Lucy McKim Garrison wrote several letters to Mary Byrne, an Irish servant and friend (1855-62); letters to Wendell Philips Garrison dating from before their marriage (1863-74); and letters to the McKim family (1859-69) and her Garrison in-laws (1852-1904). This latter group includes her letters to Ellen Wright (1852-76). </p>

		<p>Wendell's letters include one letter to Mary Byrne (1893), letters to Lucy dating from before their marriage (1863-75), as well as to his siblings (1855-1906) and his parents (1857-59).</p>
		<p>Correspondence of WLG (1838) includes the following family letters:  to his siblings (1859-95), parents (1853-78), Ellen (1863-1908), his children and daughters-in-law (1870-1909); and letters sent from the Northwest (1880), Europe (1889, 1901), and California (1903). In addition there are letters to the Buffums (1862-89) and Martha Coffin and David Wright (1864-77). These letters deal with personal, family, and household affairs; and political activities including anti-slavery, suffrage, and women's rights. Although most financial material is in SERIES V., there is some discussion about his business affairs in these letters. </p>

		<p>Fanny Garrison Villard's letters to her family (1862-1925), especially to her brother William and his wife Ellen, deal primarily with domestic matters. Letters from her husband, Henry Villard to his brother in law (1867-98) are more revealing because they relate domestic and financial and business matters. </p>
		<p><title render="italic">Generation 4</title></p>

		<p>There are twenty-five Garrisons represented in Generation 4: Marion Knight Garrison Chubb, Agnes Garrison, Charles and Margaret Carret Garrison, Eleanor Garrison, Fanny Garrison, Frank Wright and Mildred Yarnall Garrison, Lloyd McKim Garrison,  Philip McKim Garrison, Rhodes and Marianne Baehrecke Garrison, Wendell Holmes Garrison, WLG (1874) and Edith Stephenson Garrison, Charles Dyer and Katherine Garrison Norton, Garrison Villard, Helen Villard,  Harold and Mariquita Serrano Villard, and Oswald Garrison and Julia Sandford Villard. Letters of Agnes Garrison, Eleanor  Garrison, Frank Wright Garrison, WLG (1874) and Edith Stephenson Garrison, and Katherine Garrison Norton are especially significant for their content and/or quantity.</p>

		<p>Agnes was an avid traveler and correspondent. She wrote letters home from Europe and Greece (1889-1902, 1903, 1910-11), and California (1903). There are also significant runs of letters to her siblings and their families (1876-1949), especially to her sister-in law, Ellen Wright Garrison (1881-1930).</p>
		<p>Eleanor's letters are particularly significant. In addition to a large amount of general family correspondence (to her siblings and their spouses, her parents, nephew and nieces), there are letters home from Smith College (1900-04). Her letters to family, especially to her mother provide valuable insight into the New York State suffrage campaign and her work with Carrie Chapman Catt (1911-19). It is in this generation that the Garrisons, especially Eleanor, began correspondence with the Sophia Smith Collection's founder Margaret Storrs Grierson (1947-74).  These candid letters contain characteristic Garrison humor and valuable anecdotal information about the family, it's history, and the donation of the papers.  Grierson's letters to the Garrisons can be found in Subseries 2, Letters to the Garrisons.</p>
		<p>There is a significant group of letters from Frank Wright and Mildred Yarnall Garrison, especially to WLG(1874) and Edith Stephenson Garrison (1897-1960). He also wrote to Margaret Storrs Grierson and her friend, Marine Leland (1950-61). Both Frank's wife, Mildred Yarnall Garrison and Charles' wife, Margaret Carret Garrison corresponded faithfully with their Garrison in-laws.  </p>
		<p>The largest amount of correspondence in this generation is that of WLG(1874) and Edith Stephenson Garrison. Of particular interest are William's letters to Edith (1899-1948). They wrote each other frequently during the summer while Edith stayed at their vacation retreat at Wianno on Cape Cod. There are also many letters  to his siblings (1883-1948), his parents (1886-1931), his children (1910-43), and the Villlards. WLG (1874) kept carbons of outgoing correspondence between 1922 and 1933. They include indexes and are arranged by date. Some of these are business letters, others personal and may be duplicated elsewhere in the Papers.  There is also a folder of  letters to the editor and public officials (1916-30).</p>
		<p>This generation also contains a substantial collection of Katherine McKim Garrison Norton's (daughter of Wendell and Lucy McKim) correspondence.  The largest number of letters are written to her uncle Francis Jackson Garrison (1885-1916), Agnes Garrison (1881-1940), and WLG (1874) (1896-1945). Of particular interest is a four-volume set of her published letters, Katherine Garrison Norton Letters, 1881-1945, edited by her daughter Lucia Norton Valentine. These may be duplicated elsewhere, but the volumes, in addition to the letters, are particularly significant because the introductory material gives excellent insight into the family history with identifications of some family and friends.  There is also a group of letters dictated between 6 July and 8 August 1910 while she was hospitalized. They are to various people and some of  may also be duplicated elsewhere. </p>
		<p>The final group is the Villard family. Of the six Villards, Oswald Garrison Villard  was the most prolific especially to WLG (1874) and Edith Stephenson Garrison (1897-1949).</p>
		<p><title render="italic">Generation 5</title></p>

		<p>There are thirty-one Garrisons included in Generation 5: Lydia Garrison Auchincloss, Clarinda (Chloe) Garrison Binger, Edith ("Yoy") Garrison Bliss, Robert and Claire ("Tita") Garrison Emerson,  David Lloyd Garrison and Alice ("Patty") Garrison, John Bright Garrison and Barbara Foss Garrison, Robert Hale and Catherine Cooper Garrison, George Anthony and Nancy McGilpin Garrison, WLG (1902) and Jane Wilson Garrison, Lloyd Kirkham Garrison, Rhoda Garrison, Rhodes Garrison, Dorothea Villard Hammond, Reed and Faith Garrison Harwood, Estella Garrison Krantz, Charles McKim and Martha Hutcheson Norton, Garrison Norton, Aristides and Margaret Garrison Phoutrides, Katherine Knight Garrison Robinson, Alan and Lucia Norton Valentine, and Henry H. Villard.  The largest amount of material is from the children of WLG (1874): WLG (1902), Claire, David Lloyd, John Bright, Faith, and Edith. For the most part the correspondence in this generation reports on personal and family activities. </p>
		<p>When away from home (at school, while traveling, after they married and moved away) the Garrison children wrote frequently to their parents and siblings. There are long runs of correspondence to WLG (1874) and Edith from their children, especially from Claire Garrison Emerson (1911-69) and David Lloyd (1910-58). Of particular interest are David's letters home from Europe during World War II, and Claire's letters from Vassar (1921-25).</p>

		<p>This subseries is arranged in four sections. </p>
		<p>The first consists primarily of personal letters written to the Garrisons and arranged by author. These consist of large amounts of letters from one person and letters from notables.

		<p>There are groups of letters from several families: Clarks, Mays, Buffums, Daniels, and McKims. The Clarks were English cousins of the Garrisons. There are letters from twenty-one Clark cousins. These date from 1879 to 1966 and provide a long overview of two world wars and the British suffrage movement. The Daniels were a Cape Cod family and the letters date from 1876 to 1952.  Kate Daniel was a family employee and close friend of the Garrisons. She nursed WLG (1838) after his railroad accident in 1871and her husband Charles did the maintenance on the Wianno homes for the family. (See also SERIES VI. SUBJECT FILES- Wianno). His sea diary, as well as other information on the family, is located in SERIES I. BIOGRAPHCAL MATERIALS. There are six Buffums represented in this correspondence (1855-86). WLG (1838) did an apprenticeship with abolitionist James Buffum beginning in 1855. There are letters from six members of the May family. Samuel, the patriarch was a pacifist and abolitionist friend of the Garrisons. Finally there are four members of the McKim family represented including James Miller McKim and Sarah McKim, parents of Wendell Phillips Garrison's wives Lucy and Anne. </p>

		<p>Suffrage and women's rights activities are discussed by a number of correspondents. These include Susan B. Anthony (1881-1905), Alice Stone Blackwell (1896-1948), Carrie Chapman Catt (1906-47), Lydia Maria Child (1859, 1879), Helen Bright Clark (1879-1918), Charlotte Perkins Gilman (1896, 1898), Isabella Beecher Hooker (1870-89), Julia Ward Howe (n.d.), Elizabeth Pease Nicol (1876-93), Mary Gray Peck (1917-50), Emmeline and Sylvia Pankurst, (1912, 1914), Maud Wood Park (1907-51), Caroline Severance (1883-1911), Anna Howard Shaw (1897-1913), Rebecca Spring (1903-04), Elizabeth Cady Stanton (1899-1900), and Lucy Stone (1882-88).  Susan B. Anthony's letters are particularly significant. She wrote primarily to Ellen Wright Garrison (1881-1905). These personal letters also report her suffrage activities and comment on the movement in general. There are also Anthony letters in the third party correspondence in this series, as well as letters to the Wrights in SERIES X. </p>
		<p>Information about the relationship between Smith College and the Garrison family, especially Eleanor Garrison, can be found in the letters from Margaret Storrs Grierson (1947-97), Marine Leland (1955-59), and Elizabeth Duvall (1973-75).</p> 

		<p>Also of interest is a long run of letters from artist Lucy Scarborough Conant to her friend Agnes Garrison, (1883-1906) and from Nora Sayre (1962-74) to her friend Eleanor Garrison.</p> 

		<p>The second section in this subseries consists of additional letters from less well-known people to the Garrisons.</p> 

		<p>The first subsection is arranged by recipient and then alphabetically by sender. The unidentified letters in this section are arranged alphabetically by first name. Of interest in this section are a group of letters to Ellen Wright Garrison from her Eagleswood School friends (1857-60).
The second subsection contains condolence letters written to family members on the deaths of Ellen Wright Garrison (1931), Francis Jackson Garrison (1916), Frank Wright Garrison (1961), Helen Benson Garrison (1876), William Lloyd Garrison (1805) (1879), William Lloyd Garrison (1838) (1909), William Lloyd Garrison (1874) (1964), Katherine Garrison Norton (1948), Benjamin T.

These letters are from family and friends and contain letters from notable people that were friends of the Garrisons.</p>

		<p>Finally there is a subsection of postcards to the Garrisons arranged in no particular order.</p>
		<p><title render="bold">Third party correspondence</title></p>

		<p>The third subseries consists of letters arranged by author. When both sides of the correspondence exist they have been combined. The origin of these letters is not always clear; some are copies made by Martha Coffin Wright and Frank Wright Garrison.

There are letters of the McKims to Mary Byrne, an Irish servant who became a close family friend. (See also Lucy McKim Garrison's and Annie McKim Dennis Garrison's correspondence in subseries 1, Generation 3). There is a miscellaneous category that includes letters to Mary Randall (1908, n.d.) and a number of unidentified third party letters. </p>

		<p>This series contains writings by twenty-seven Garrisons. It is arranged alphabetically by person and includes speeches, writings, poetry, notes, and in some cases related correspondence. (See also SERIES VI . SUBJECT FILES and SERIES XI. SCRAPBOOKS.) The Garrisons were prolific poets and there are large amounts of original poetry in this series. </p>

		<p>WLG (1838) and WLG (1874) produced the bulk of these writings.  The section on WLG (1838) contains a diary of miscellaneous poetry (1878), high school compositions (1854-55), and writings and speeches arranged alphabetically by subject. The alphabetical list includes tributes and commemorative verse.  There are birthday verses he wrote for his own birthdays and prose and verses he wrote for family and friends. There are also verses about Osterville (1876-98) and Quincy School (1891-97), verses arranged alphabetically by title (1880-1906), untitled verse arranged by date (1863-1908) and notes (n.d.). </p>

		<p>For WLG (1874) there are school essays, and speeches and writings by topic (abolition, peace, race issues, taxation, suffrage etc.) Within this alphabetical list is a group of speeches entitled Technology Talks (1924 and 1933) and talks to the Tuesday Club (1931-40). There are two folders of miscellaneous speeches and writings which concern other topics, including introductory remarks for Booker T. Washington and Charles Eastman. Within this alphabetical list is poetry which includes complete texts and notes and some background material he used to compose the verse. When possible the poetry is arranged by subject (i.e. Anniversary, birthday and commemorative verse, Cape Cod, Coffin and Burr, Harvard (class reunions and other activities), poetry written anonymously under the initials GLW). Otherwise the poems are organized by date; those with no dates are alphabetical by title. The largest group of poems are the commemorative poems written in memoriam and in celebration of others. These include family members, especially the Villards, his wife and children, as well as friends and neighbors. These are arranged  in a separate alphabetical section by person, with two folders of poems for miscellaneous people. The final group of poetry includes unidentified, undated and incomplete items.</p>

		<p>David Lloyd Garrison's autobiographical work Early and Late (1994), Lucy McKim Garrison's transcriptions original slave songs (which are located in the Flat File), and a compilation of Garrison family writings, Garrisoniana (1869-1902) are also noteworthy.</p>

		<p>This series contains financial material related to twelve members of the Garrison Family. It is arranged alphabetically by person and contains tax information, probate and estate records, inventories, items related to real estate, ledgers, business diaries, expense logs and related correspondence. Financial/business correspondence related to property owned at Cape Cod is located in SERIES VI. SUBJECT FILES - Wianno. The largest amounts of material relate to both the WLG (1838)'s and WLG (1874)'s business and personal affairs. </p>
		<p>WLG (1838)'s business material includes brokerage (1873) and mortgage (1889-1901) books and an investment ledger (1889-92), as well as a sales journal (1877-78). There is material related to trust accounts he handled for Mary E. Robinson, Theodore Dwight Weld, Eliza Church, and Theodore Grinké Weld (1875-1903). The personal material includes correspondence (1903-10), estate matters (1892-1936), real estate (1903-10), personal securities (1903), expenses (1890-1904), and ledgers (1872-1900). </p>

		<p>This series, arranged alphabetically, contains printed material, memorabilia, and related correspondence on forty-one subjects which were of interest to the Garrisons, or about organizations in which they were involved. These topics range far and wide: reform movements (free trade, single tax, suffrage), minor controversies (the dangers of football and the reform of hockey rules), health issues (anti-vaccination, osteopathy, homeopathy), schools and camps (Auburn Female Seminary, Eagleswood School, Country Day School for Boys, Roxbury Latin School, Harvard University, Sidney Lanier Camp), and Garrison homes and retreats (Wianno).  Some of the subjects relate to only one Garrison, others relate to several and span the generations. The largest and/or richest subjects are abolition (1833-1962), anti-vaccination (1895-1938), free trade and tariff reform (1887-1959), Harvard University (1891-1967), immigration (1871-1924), pacifism (1839-1940), race (1888-1936), single tax (1877-1947), suffrage (1856-1952), temperance (1828-1908), and Wianno (1905-1966). Anti-imperialism, free trade, single tax, and pacifism contain interrelated material.  Many of these subjects are included in the WLG (1838) scrapbooks in SERIES IX. SERIES I. BIOGRAPHICAL MATERIAL, SERIES IV. SPEECHES AND WRITING and within the correspondence in SERIES III. Some of the subjects include periodicals and organizations which are listed separately. In addition there are general periodicals and organizations unrelated to any specific subject.</p>
		<p>The abolition files are particularly significant. These include published material on the American (1833-84) and Massachusetts (1837-41) Anti-Slavery Societies; "Anti-Slavery Reminiscences" by Elizabeth Buffum Chase; correspondence of  Maria Weston Chapman, (1835, 1837), James Miller McKim (1849, 1866) and George Thompson (1835); material related to The Liberator including a subscription letter (1839); memorabilia (1858-61); printed material, including Anti-Slavery Tracts (1860, n.d.); general articles and clippings (1854-1948) and; pamphlets (1850-85) and specific printed material on the Fugitive Slave Law (1851-80) and the Kansas/Nebraska Act (1854-60). A run of The Liberator is located in the SSC Periodicals collection. British abolitionist George Thompson came to the United States with a stipend from the Anti-Slavery Women of Glasgow and Edinburgh in 1834. His letters (Feb-Apr 1835) are reports of this trip written to Miss Smeal and the Committee of the Glasgow Ladies. Correspondence of Maria Weston Chapman which includes a "Report to the Ladies of Scotland" (1835) is related to the Thompson letters. There is also a record of departed abolitionists (circa 1880) and material related to abolition reunions and anniversaries, (1886-89, n.d.). Items related to the American Freedman's Union Commission (1869, n.d.) are included in this file. </p>
		<p>There is documentation of an interesting incident involving the propriety of female store clerks. In 1849, women's rights reformers Elizabeth McClintock and Anna Southwick applied for a position in the Philadelphia wholesale business of Edward M. Davis (Lucretia Mott's son-in-law). Elizabeth Cady Stanton wrote a letter in support of the women's application. Davis brought the matter before his male clerks and in the end the application was refused. Some of the employees drew caricatures of female clerks. Lucretia Mott sent the drawings to McClintock who responded in kind, enclosing drawings and a "drama." Most of the drawings are unsigned, but it is presumed that those which portray women clerks in a more positive light were drawn by McClintock or Maria Mott Davis. In addition to the drawing and skit, this file contains correspondence and items from E.M Davis Co. </p>
		<p>Free trade and tariff reform is documented by several free trade organizations: American Free Trade League (1889-1917), Free Trade League (1919-21), International Free Trade League (1918-26), and New England Free Trade League (1896-98). WLG (1838) was secretary of the American Free Trade League and edited the Free Trade Broadside of which there are copies from 1905 to 1916. Frank Wright Garrison was on the Executive Committee for the International Free Trade League and WLG (1874) was a member. In addition to executive committee minutes and printed material, there is a long sequence of related correspondence (1917-59) as well as clippings, pamphlets, and flyers. </p>
		<p>The Harvard University material relates primarily to WLG (1874), class of 1897, with a small amount of material related to David Lloyd Garrison, class of 1928. It contains class reunion material, correspondence and printed items on eight Harvard related organizations including D.K.E. (1891-92), the Harvard Club of Boston (1912-41), the Harvard Liberal Club of Boston (1918-21) and Harvard Total Abstinence League (1912, n.d.). There is also some miscellaneous correspondence (1895-1960).</p>
		<p>The immigration file relates primarily to Chinese immigration and includes material on the Chinese Defense Fund (1903-04), Chinese Equal Rights League (1892), and National Liberal Immigration League (1907-08). There are quite a few printed items (1885-1924) including pamphlets, articles, clippings, and related correspondence (1871-1908).</p>
		<p>There are thirty-one separately filed organizations plus ten folders of small amounts of organizational material. These organizations with items dating from 1897 to 1964 represent the wide range of interests and reform movements in which the Garrisons were involved. These range from liberal causes (American Civil Liberties Union, American Friends Service Committee, Free Religious Association of America, and League for Democratic Control) to conservation and birding organizations (Massachusetts Audubon Society, Nature Conservancy, and Nuttall Ornithological Club) and genealogical societies  (Massachusetts Society of Colonial Dames and New England Historic Genealogical Society). </p>
		<p>The Garrison summer retreat was located on Cape Cod, at Wianno in Osterville, Massachusetts. Osterville material consists of reports, correspondence, clippings, and printed material on the Osterville Free Public Library. (WLG (1874) was on its board of trustees for many years.)  There are also items related to reunions of residents of Osterville (1905-07) plus miscellaneous historical items (1877-1969). Wianno documents include blueprints (1912-27); maintenance, insurance, real estate and miscellaneous correspondence (1905-50); deeds, titles and inventories (1920-43); and correspondence, organizational documents and printed material on the on the Wianno Club (1904-33).  </p>
		<p>The pacifism file contains correspondence and printed material (1907-25); a file on military training (1904-26); and correspondence and printed material on peace organizations including American Union Against Militarism, the Women's Peace Party (1915-17), and the Women's Peace Society (1920-25). </p>
		<p>There are twelve periodical titles, including an issue of the Boston Patriot (1810), The Diamond (1851-52) edited by George Garrison while a student at the Hopedale Home School, and The Liberator edited by Max Eastman (1917-18).</p>
		<p>There is an extensive and rich file of race related to racial discrimination. Subjects include anti-lynching (1888-1904), education (1894-1930), Negro troops (1898-1906), suffrage (1898-1906), and miscellaneous printed material (1895-1914). The education file contains correspondence and printed material on Berea College (1894-09), Calhoun Colored School (1909-26), Forsythe Normal and Industrial School (1902-18), Hampton Normal and Agriculture Institute (1919-21), and Tuskegee Institute (1985-1930). </p>
		<p>The largest file in this series is on the single tax. There is extensive correspondence especially with political reformer and single taxer Daniel Kiefer, writings of Henry George, and records of fifteen separate single tax organizations including various state single tax leagues, the Single Tax Party, and the United Committee for the Taxation of land Values.  There are runs of eleven single tax periodicals. Printed material includes articles and pamphlets (1887-1935), clippings (1888-1928),  "quotable authorities" collected by WLG (1838) (1887-1905), and miscellaneous material (1887-1932). </p>
		<p>WLG (1838), Ellen Wright Garrison, Eleanor Garrison, Agnes Garrison, WLG (1874), and Edith Stephenson Garrison were all suffragists. There is a particularly rich collection of suffrage items related to their activities. There is also suffrage material elsewhere, especially in SERIES III. CORRESPONDENCE, SERIES IV. WRITINGS AND SPEECHES, and in SERIES IX. WRIGHT FAMILY. The file contains correspondence (1898-1952); printed material and clippings, (1867-916) from both the British and American suffrage movement; memorabilia (1900-50); records of nine suffrage organizations; and documents related to three suffrage/woman's right conventions (1856, 1870, 1872).</p>

		<p>The temperance file is related to both alcohol and tobacco. It contains articles, clippings, pamphlets, and miscellaneous printed material (1879-1908), information on the Massachusetts Total Abstinence Society (n.d.), and the Women's Christian Temperance Union (1919). Of particular interest is an issue of the National Philanthropist (1828) edited by WLG (1805).</p>

		<p>This series is divided into six subseries: Family, Friends and associates, Subjects, Albums, Cased images, and Oversize material. </p>
		<p>The first subseries includes photographs of the following family groups: Bliss, Chubb, Emerson, Garrison, Harwood, Norton, Phoutrides, Stephenson, Villard, and Wright. Women are filed under their married names except for those of Ellen Wright Garrison with her siblings which are located with the Wright Family.  They are arranged alphabetically; photographs with multiple family members located under the name of the father.   Additional photographs of individuals can be found in family groups, Albums, Cased images and Oversize material, and in the Sophia Smith Collection Flat File.  </p>
		<p>The Friends and associates subseries includes photographs of individuals the Garrisons knew personally as well as photographs collected by the Garrisons. They are arranged alphabetically and include photographs of such notables as Lydia Maria Child, Frederick Douglass, George Eliot, Sara Jane Lippincott, Harriet Tubman, Isabella Beecher Hooker, Lucretia Coffin Mott, Emmeline Pankhurst, Theodore Parker, Hattie and Robert Purvis, Caroline Severance, Lucy Stone, and Wendell Phillips. There are additional photographs of famous friends contained in two albums located in the fourth subseries in box 215.  </p>
		<p>The Subjects subseries includes photographs arranged by topic. These include abolition, suffrage, and houses and vacation places. There are photographs of abolitionist groups at Ambleside and Lucy Stone's House as well as the Executive Committee of the Pennsylvania Anti Slavery Society. The suffrage photographs include two groups: one of which includes Susan B. Anthony, Rebecca Spring, Charlotte Wills, and Caroline Wills, and another of Anthony, Carrie Chapman Catt, Lila Sweet Martin, Anna Howard Shaw, Harriet May Mills, and Lucy Anthony.  There is also a photograph of  New York suffragists in "farmerette" costumes and suffrage parades. The Houses and Vacation places are arranged alphabetically; the family homes by family (Benson, Coffin-Mott, Garrison) and then by location. The largest group of photographs is of Wianno, the Garrisons summer "colony" on Cape Cod and it includes the various cottages as well as land and seascapes. </p>
		<p>The next three subseries are arranged randomly according to size The Albums contain both family and non-family photographs, some of which may be duplicated elsewhere in the series. There are two albums of negatives. Some of the photographs have either been removed from their albums, or the pages removed from their bindings for preservation reasons.</p>
		<p>The Cased images (arranged by large, medium and small) include tintypes, daguerreotypes, and ambrotypes. Those of the Wright family are particularly fine. The Oversize material contains photographs of family including family groups, for example Thanksgiving 1886, Frank Wright and Mildred Yarnall Garrison's wedding photograph, and school athletic team and class photographs of  various Garrisons, especially WLG (1874). Photographs located in the Flat File are listed at the end of the box list with the rest of the Flat File items. </p>

		<p>This series is arranged in two subseries. The first, Family, contains Garrison family memorabilia which encompasses either more than one Garrison or is unidentified. This subseries contains family games (n.d.), valentines and greeting card (n.d.), material on character analysis (1913-50), numerology and metaphysics (1922-26), and a box of medals and ribbons (1895-1914). Of particular interest are a series of cookbooks, household lists, accounts, recipes, and an arithmetic primer. Although many have names attached to them, their origin is unclear. It is assumed that the cookbooks were passed down through generations because the handwriting varies throughout. The earliest is dated 1694 and the latest 1834, although many are undated. </p>

Ellen Wright Garrison's material includes her hair collection and paper dolls.  Items of WLG (1805) include an address book listing donations to fugitive slaves, and autopsy report (1869), and documents related to the purchase of the family home at Rockledge (1853-64). Memorabilia of WLG (1838) and WLG (1874) contains significant amounts of collected material (verse, jokes, quotes). There is a handwriting analysis for WLG (1838) and a notebook of writings from an Osterville tea (1877).

Items related to Peter Pelham include a notice of his death, accounts of a shipment of  the Pelham's belongings to Florida (1824), and the settling of his estate (1827). Included in this subseries is a "Sketch of the life and character of  David Wright"  by Theodore M. Pomeroy (1898) and personal reminiscences of his life which he wrote in 1886. Martha Coffin Wright's biographical file includes a sketch written by Eliza Wright Osborne in the 1890s. In this sketch Osborne mentions a will written by Martha when she was a 15 years old. In 2001 her great-great grandson, James D. Livingston provided a copy, which is now included with the sketch. There are also certificates, obituaries, condolence letters, her final will (1864), and a document of disassociation from the Society of Friends (1825). In addition there are her account books (1829-52), drawings, collected verse and a small notebook entitled "Excerpts from the Portfolio of Josiah Landon, 1810" written in her hand.</p>
		<p>The second subseries, Correspondence, is divided into two sections; Letters from the Wrights and Letters to the Wrights. It includes family letters between spouses, siblings, cousins, friends, parents and children.  They not only provide a view of nineteenth century social history and family life, but also give valuable insights into abolition, suffrage, women's rights and the people involved in those movements.  The letters are interspersed with drawings and full of wit and humor. It should be noted that although they are arranged alphabetically by author, many were evidently handed around before being sent and are authored by two or more people, and many of these letters are round robin and were written to a number of different people. Also, in order to save paper, some letters were written in the blank spaces of other letters and some are written with the script going in two or three directions. Many of these letters have been photocopied for preservation purposes, some have been transcribed and typed copies have been included with the handwritten counterparts. There are also hand written copies made by Martha Coffin Wright for some of the letters. </p>
		<p>Of special note are letters written from Eagleswood School by Anna Coffin Temple Brown to Lucretia Coffin Mott and from Anna Davis Hallowell to Ellen Wright Garrison; Civil War letters  from William Pelham Wright (1861-63), from his friend Andrew Cowan to William and David Wright (1862-63), and from Marianna Pelham Mott while she was at  Gettysburg caring for her injured brother William (1863);  and European travel letters from Marianna Pelham Mott (1855-69), Thomas Mott (1855-56), and Eliza Wright Osborne (1889, 1903). The letters among Lucretia Coffin Mott, Martha Coffin Wright, Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Ellen Wright Garrison, Ida Husted Harper, and Victoria Claflin Woodhull provide a particularly detailed description of the seeds of the American women's movement, and the planning of the early women's right conventions, especially the first in 1848 and the third in 1856. </p>
		<p>Of further interest are early Pelham family letters to Martha Coffin Wright (1824-65); letters from Putnam Catlin, father of artists Julius and George Catlin, to Martha Coffin Wright (1828-39); and letters from Henry Blackwell (1869), Matilda Joslyn Gage  (1870-72), Lucretia and Martha's cousins Mary Hussey Earle (1842-75) and Phebe Hussey Gardner (1843), Sara Jane Lippincott (Grace Greenwood) (1860-65), Wendell Phillips (1860), Parker Pillsbury (1869-73), Theodore Dwight Weld and Angelina Grimké Weld (1854-62), and a fugitive slave, L. M. Worden (1845-70). </p>
		<p>Writings, the third subseries, includes Hints to Young People On The Duties of Civil Life (1826) by James Mott, and miscellaneous writings of Lucretia Coffin Mott (1828-69) including her Discourse on Women (1850, 1869), a discourse at a Friends Meeting in New York (1866), and a statement to the Equal Rights Convention at Albany (1866). Some of these writings are copies of originals located at the Huntington Library, Swarthmore Peace Collection, and the Historical Society of Pennsylvania.  There are also original and typed copies of Martha Coffin Wright's diaries (1854-74) and her poetry (1844-64). Although the diaries are short entry, they contain references to such notables as Harriet Tubman, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, and Lucy Stone. Her miscellaneous writings include a draft of "Hints for Wives" which was read by Lucretia Coffin Mott at the Seneca Falls convention (1848). In addition, there are the Civil War writings of William Pelham Wright about the First New York Battery and a diary (1862). The former includes a list of officers, causalities and battles in which the Battery was engaged. </p>

Benjamin Turner Stephenson (1886) was an artist, and included in an 1898 letter to Edith is a set of  paper dolls. There is also a substantial number of letters from Walter Stephenson to Edith and WLG (1838) (1915-43) and David Lloyd Garrison (1918-49). The latter includes a scrapbook "file of letters together with enclosures, clippings of writings of Lucien Price and some others" (1927-29).
