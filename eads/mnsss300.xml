    <head>Biographical Note</head>
       <p>Margaret Hepburn was born in Freehold, N.J. in 1896, the daughter and grandaughter
of physicians.  After graduating from Freehold High School she attended Smith College where
she majored in sociology and music, and graduated in 1918.  She married Cecil Denise Snyder
of Freehold that same year.  Her daughter Anne was born in 1920.  In order to further Cecil
Snyder's career, the family moved  to Kenosha, Wisconsin in 1929.  Margaret Snyder began
volunteering at the Orthopedic School in Kenosha in 1931.   In 1940 she became a charter
member of Kenosha Hospital Auxiliary.   In 1947 she expanded her involvement to the state
level hospital auxiliary associations  and by 1952 she was appointed to the Committee of
Hospital Auxiliaries of the American Hospital Association.  She also participated in the
International Hospital Federation meetings in Sweden in 1956 and Belgium  in 1962.
Following the death of her husband in 1956 Margaret Snyder assumed a staff position at
Kenosha Memorial Hospital, thus becoming its first fulltime Director of Volunteers.  In this
capacity she explored new approaches to patient care by expanding volunteer services
throughout the hospital.  After retiring from this position in 1965 Snyder remained active
in hospital and church affairs in Kenosha  for a few years before she relocated to Provo,
Utah to be near family members.</p>
