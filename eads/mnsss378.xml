<bioghist id="bioghist">
    
       <p>The Women's Action for New Directions was founded in 1980 by Dr. Helen Caldicott as a Washington, DC lobbying group comprised largely of mothers concerned about the proliferation of nuclear arms. The organization has chapters throughout the U.S. as well as in several other countries. Its purpose was "to educate people to use their voting, purchasing, lobbying and other powers...to halt and reverse the nuclear arms race, and seek peaceful solutions to domestic and international problems...." This was to be accomplished through political action on the national level, and grassroots organizing and education through local "affiliates." The organization was originally called the Women's Party for Survival, then Women's Action for Nuclear Disarmament.  The name was changed again circa 1992 to reflect their broadened focus.</p>
