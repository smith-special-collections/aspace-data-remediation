<bioghist id="bioghist">
       
       <p>In 1995 Dianne Doherty, Sally Livingston, and Martha Richards traveled to the United Nations
Fourth World Conference on Women, in Beijing, China, to learn about the plight of the world's
women. Their experience inspired them to create the Women's Fund of Western Massachusetts in 1997.
The premise was to mobilize significant resources to address the pressing needs of women and girls
in Western Massachusetts. The WFWM, located in Easthampton, MA, advances social change philanthropy
to create economic and social equality for women and girls in the region through grantmaking,
strategic advocacy, and community collaborations.  The program work addresses the core concerns of
educational access and success, economic justice, and freedom from violence. The organization has
three major strategies to achieve its goals:  mobilize and support women's philanthropy; make
strategic grants to nonprofit organizations that work with women and girls toward progressive
social change; and advocate for system improvements for women and girls through research,
education, and collaboration.  Carla Oleska has served as executive director since 2006, and has
been connected with the Fund since its inception, both as a grantee partner and donor.</p>
