She worked as a freelance photographer in New York City from 1972-77, documenting the women's movement and women's sports for <title render="italic">Ms.</title> Magazine and other publications.  From 1977-84, she was a staff photographer for the <title render="italic">Newark Star-Ledger</title> covering the New York City metropolitan area on news, features, sports, personalities, fashion, and commerical assignments.  She moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico, in 1984 where she  worked as a news editor and videographer for KOAT-TV.  In 1987 she established her own business, Cary Herz Photography, doing freelance photojournalism, and editorial, corporate, and location photography.
