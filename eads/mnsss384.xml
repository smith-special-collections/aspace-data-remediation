    <head>Biographical Note</head>
       <p>Jane Garrett earned her B.A. in history from the University of Delaware in 1957. From 1975 to 1978, she was enrolled in the Diocesan Studies Program at the Episcopal Diocese of Vermont, and during the 1978-79 academic year she studied at the Hartford Seminary.  She returned to Vermont in 1979 and studied Clinical Pastoral Education for a year at the Medical Center Hospital of Vermont.  Middlebury College awarded her an Honorary Doctorate in Letters 1997, and in 2000 the University of Delaware awarded her a Medal of Distinction. From 1957 to 1968, Garrett was employed at the Boston Athenaeum, first in the Acquisitions Department and then as Assistant to the Director.  While employed at the Athenaeum, and prior to being hired by  Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., she also worked as an editor for the New York Historical Society (1966 to 1967).  From 1967 to 1973, she was Editor and Special Assistant to Alfred A. Knopf; she worked as an Editor full-time from 1974 to 1996, when she was promoted to Senior Editor. Garrett has specialized in working with noted authors of U.S. history, many of whom have won Pulitzer Prizes and other awards for books that she helped bring to press.  Concurrent to pursuing her career at Knopf, Garrett has continued to be involved in the Episcopal Church; she  was ordained as a Deacon in 1980 and as a Priest in 1981.  She has been active in church politics, especially with regard to its attitudes toward and stated positions on homosexuality and same-sex unions.</p>

<scopecontent id="scope">
      <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
       <p>Since Garrett is an Episcopal priest and has been very active in church politics, these materials offer valuable insight into the inner workings of the church; the broader social, political and cultural aspects of these issues are also well-documented. Approximately half of this collection consists of files pertaining to homosexuality and same- sex marriage, notably the struggle within the Episcopal Church to come to terms with these issues.   The other half consists of files pertaining to authors with whom Garrett worked in her capacity as an editor at Alfred A. Knopf.  Most of the authors are noted U.S. historians, and these files may be of interest for what they reveal about the author/editor relationship.  There is also a small amount of material from her work with the Standing Commission on Anglican and International Peace with Justice Concerns on AIDS in Kuala Lumpur, and documents and photographs of Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe).</p>
