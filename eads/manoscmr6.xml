         <p>CAROLYN G. HEILBRUN, 1926-2003</p>
         <p>In 1993, Carolyn Heilbrun became Avalon Foundation Professor in the Humanities Emerita at Columbia University, after thirty-three years of teaching there.  She had fellowships from the Guggenheim and Rockefeller Foundations, and from the NEH.  In 1984, she was President of the Modern Language Association.  She was a visiting professor at Princeton, Swarthmore, Yale, Union Theological Seminary, the University of California, and at Columbia and Yale Law schools and has received many honorary degrees from colleges and universities.  She received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Modern Language Association in 2000, and was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2000. Heilbrun published:  <title>The Garnett Family</title>, <title>Christopher Isherwood</title>, <title>Toward a Recognition of Androgyny</title>, <title>Reinventing Womanhood</title>, <title>Writing a Woman's Life</title> , <title>Hamlet's Mother and Other Women</title>, <title>The Education of A Woman:  A Life of Gloria Steinem</title>, <title>The Last Gift of Time</title>, and <title>the University of Toronto Alexander Lectures</title>, <title>Women's Lives: The View from the Threshold</title>, and <title>When All Our Models Were Men: My Teachers Barzun, Fadiman, Trilling</title>.  She published numerous articles and reviews. Under the name Amanda Cross, she published fourteen mystery novels. Heilbrun died on October 9, 2003.</p>
         <p>RICHARD GARNETT, 1835-1906</p>
         <p>Richard Garnett was an English librarian and writer. He served on the staff of the British Museum (1851-1899) as keeper of printed books (1890-1899); and director (from 1880).  In 1905 Garnett published a general catalogue of the British Museum.  He also wrote <title>Relics of Shelley</title> (1862), <title>The Twilight of the Gods</title> (1888, fables), <title>History of Italian Literature</title> (1897), and several biographies.  Richard Garnett was the father of Edward Garnett.</p>
         <p>CONSTANCE (BLACK) GARNETT, 1862-1946</p>
         <p>Constance Garnett was the wife of Edward Garnett and mother of David Garnett.  Her translations of many Russian writers, such as Dostoevsky, achieved great popularity in the first two decades of the twentieth century and had a profound influence on modernist writers.  Garnett studied classics at Newnham College, Cambridge University, and began to learn Russian in the early 1890s.</p>
         <p>EDWARD GARNETT, 1868-1937</p>
         <p>Edward Garnett was the father of David Garnett, husband of Constance Garnett, and son of Richard Garnett. As a publisher's reader and critic, he discovered, advised, and tutored many British writers, including Conrad, Galsworthy, Ford Maddox Ford, D.H. Lawrence, and W.H. Hudson.  Garnett also authored plays, including <title>The Breaking Point</title> (1907), <title>The Feud</title> (1907), and <title>The Trial of Jeanne d'Arc</title> (1912).</p>
         <p>DAVID GARNETT, 1892-1981</p>
         <p>David Garnett was the only child of Edward and Constance Garnett, and was known almost universally as "Bunny."  Although trained at the Royal College of Science as a botanist, he later turned to a highly successful literary career.  Among his twenty-one works of fiction, <title>Lady into Fox</title> (1922) is notable for having won both the Hawthornden and Tait-Black prizes for 1923.  The unexpected success of this novel led Bunny to withdraw in 1924 from the bookshop he had established in 1920 with Francis Birell to devote more time to his writing.  From 1923 to 1935 he was partner in the <title>Nonesuch Press</title>, and from 1932 to 1935 he was literary editor of the <title>New Statesman and Nation</title>.  He wrote several memoirs.</p>
         <p>CHRISTOPHER ISHERWOOD, 1904-1986</p>
         <p>Christopher Isherwood was an American-English novelist, poet and playwright. He authored autobiographical and quasi-autobiographical works including the short-story collection <title>Goodbye to Berlin</title> (1939), the novels: <title>The World in the Evening</title> (1954), <title>Down There On A Visit</title> (1962), <title>A Meeting by the River</title> (1967), and <title>Christopher and His Kind</title> (1976). His work included screenwriting for various film studios (from 1939). As a convert, Isherwood wrote, edited, and translated works on Vedantism.</p>
