     <p>According to their Web site, "WORTH (Women On the Rise Telling HerStory) is an
advocacy/consultant group comprised of currently and formerly incarcerated women, who have the
expertise and understanding to engage, navigate and challenge policy and perceptions concerning
incarcerated women." Co-founder and current chair, Tina Reynolds was in prison when she gave birth
to her seventh child in 1994.  Shackled for her labor and delivery, Reynolds used that most
humiliating experience to inspire her work for formerly and currently incarcerated women after her
release in 1995.  WORTH, founded in 2004 and based in New York City, is made up of three
components: 1) the Core Leadership group which oversees the day-to-day running of the organization;
2) The Sister Circle which provides training and support, both personally and professionally, for
WORTH members; and 3) the Speakers' Bureau which represents WORTH at conferences, schools,
religious institutions, prisons and other public venues.  In 2009, WORTH achieved one of their
first reform goals when New York became the sixth state to ban the shackling of women prisoners
before, during or after birth.   For more information, see the
