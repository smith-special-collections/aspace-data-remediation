Her best-known sculptures are <title render="italic">Earth, Mother, Goddess</title> and <title render="italic">Walking Nude Mirror</title>. Walsh exhibited in the first all-women art exhibit titled <title render="italic">X-12</title> in New York City in 1969, and co-founded Women Artist Filmmakers in 1973. Her films include <title render="italic">The Martyrdom of Marilyn Monroe</title>, and <title render="italic">Happy Birthday, I'm 40</title>, an autobiographical film, as well as <title render="italic">Women Bound and Unbound</title>, a multimedia performance presented at the National Women's Conference in Houston and funded by the Ms Foundation.
