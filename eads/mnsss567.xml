<bioghist id="bioghist">
       
     <p>The daughter of Puerto Rican immigrants, Rosario Morales (1930-2011) was raised in el barrio
of New York City. In 1949, Morales joined the Communist Party and married Richard Levins, the son
of Ukranian Jewish immigrants and a scientist. Together they moved to Puerto Rico in 1951 where
they became active in the Puerto Rican Communist Party and the Fellowship of Reconciliation while
working a small farm in the mountains. They eventually returned to the U.S., first to Chicago then
to Cambridge, but the people and culture of Puerto Rico remained at the center of Morales' work.
Morales and her daughter Aurora Levins Morales became active in the women's movement in the late
1960s, were a part of the Chicago Women's Liberation Union, and co-authored a book of poetry and
prose called Getting Home Alive in 1986. Despite struggles to be taken seriously as a scholar,
Rosario Morales was recognized as a major contemporary Puerto Rican writer. Morales contributed to
the groundbreaking book, <title render="italic">This
Bridge Called My Back</title>, a collection of writings by women of color
feminists, and her work appeared in numerous journals and anthologies. In addition to the Communist
Party and the Chicago Women's Liberation Union, Rosario Morales was involved in a number of other
organizations related to her identities as a feminist, Marxist, working class, Puerto RIcan woman.
Rosario Morales died in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 2011.</p>

     <p>The Rosario Morales Papers contain correspondence, writings (manuscripts, drafts, journals,
free writing, publications), conference files, memorabilia, and awards that document her personal
and professional life as an author, poet, feminist, and activist. The materials in this collection
primarily date back to the 1980s and 1990s, and are especially reflective of Rosario Morales'
processes as a writer. Writings included here are primarily autobiographical, focusing on her
identity as a Puerto Rican feminist. Morales' writings often underscore the importance of
intersectionality in the feminist movement. Other topics covered include communism/Marxism, writing
and publishing processes, Cuba and the Cuban blockade, and feminist theory. Of note is
correspondence with Gloria Anzaldua and Cherrie Moraga, the editors of the 1981 anthology <title render="italic">This
Bridge Called My Back</title>, including notes on public readings and publicity for the groundbreaking book
by and about women of color.  The papers also include some materials of her daughter, writer Aurora
Levins Morales.</p>
