<bioghist id="bioghist">
       
     <p>Silvia Pfeiffer Tennenbaum was born in Frankfurt, Germany, the daughter of Lotti Clara Stern
and Erich Pfeiffer-Belli.  Her parents divorced in 1930 and in 1934, her mother married William
Steinberg, a conductor who would lead several symphonies, including the Pittsburgh Symphony
Orchestra (1952-1976).  The Steinberg family fled Nazi Germany in 1936 and young Silvia spent the
next two years living in Basel, Switzerland with her Aunt, Getrude Ritz-Stern.  In 1938, reunited
with her mother, stepfather and stepbrother, she emigrated to America where the family settled in
New Rochelle, New York. Silvia Pfeiffer graduated from New Rochelle High School in 1946; she then
attended Barnard College, earning a BA with honors in Art History in 1950. She started graduate
school at Columbia University but left in 1951 upon her marriage to Lloyd Tennenbaum, a rabbi.  The
Tennenbaums lived the next seven years in Lynchburg, Virginia--it was during these years that
Silvia Tennenbaum gave birth to three sons and started her writing career.  Twenty years later, she
would parlay that experience into her first book, <title render="italic">Rachel the Rabbi's Wife</title> (1978).  After a brief
stint in Plainfield, New Jersey, Lloyd Tennenbaum was appointed rabbi to two congregations on Long
Island's North Shore and the family settled in Huntington, New York where Silvia Tennenbaum began
writing in earnest.  In 1981, after thirty years of marriage, the Tennenbaums separated and were
divorced in 1986.  By then, Silvia Tennenbaum had returned to graduate school at Columbia
University and completed her MA in art history in 1983.   An avid traveller and prolific diarist,
she is also the author of <title render="italic">Yesterday's Streets</title> (1981), a fictionalized account of life amongst
upper-middle class Jews in Frankfurt, Germany from the start of the twentieth century to the Nazi
take-over.  In 2012, the city that Silvia Tennenbaum had fled from as a young child to escape the
Holocaust decades earlier named <title render="italic">Yesterday's Streets</title> as their "Book of the Year."</p>
