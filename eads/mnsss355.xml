<scopecontent id="scope">
      
       <p>The Sports Collection contains printed material documenting women and girls struggles to break into male-dominated sports such as baseball, basketball, boating, football swimming, soccer, and track and field, among others. The bulk of the collection consists of newspaper clippings and dates from the 1970s. Topics range from collegiate and professional sports to youth sports (Little League baseball in particular).  It also includes printed materials on information on the Women's Equity Action League Educational and Legal Defense Fund (WEAL) and its interpretations of Title IX - Educational Amendments of 1972 which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in all federally funded education programs. There is one unpublished paper by Ann Louise Oates, former Smith College student, entitled "Women in sports" (1974).</p>
            <p> NOTE: The container list for this collection is available in the Sophia Smith Collection.  Please contact us to request a copy.</p>
