     <p>Fannie Fletcher Clement was born in Roxbury, Massachusetts, circa 1881, the daughter of Maria Edwards and Dr. George Clement.  She graduated from Smith College in 1903. Her father advised her not to become a doctor because it was "too difficult for a woman" so she became a nurse instead and worked for a number of years with the American Red Cross and was director of the ARC Town and Country Nursing Service in rural Appalachia, including Eastern Kentucky, circa 1912-17.  In 1919, Clement joined the Smith College Relief Unit in Grecourt, France.  In the 1930s she lived in Pelham, New Hampshire.  In 1949 she retired to Florida where she died in 1950.</p>
