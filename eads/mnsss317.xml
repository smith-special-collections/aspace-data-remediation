       <p>Elizabeth Yates was born and educated in Buffalo, New York.  She married William McGreal in 1929 and for ten years they traveled extensively and lived in London.  After their return to the U.S., they made their home on a farm in Peterborough, New Hampshire. Yates was the author of more than twenty-one books for adults and children.  Her best-known work is <title render="italic">Amos Fortune: Free Man</title> (1950) which won the Newberry Medal, the Herald Tribune Award, and the William Allen White Children's Award.   Her book <title render="italic">Rainbow Round the World</title> won the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom Award.  In addition to writing, Yates served as staff member for various writers' conferences (such as those at the University of Connecticut, the University of  Indiana, and the University of New Hampshire ), as a lecturer, and as the Director of the New Hampshire  Association for the Blind.</p>
 	<p> Effie Douglass Putnam was the sister of Loretto Putnam, the second wife of Elizabeth Yates' grandfather.  Effie was born in Flint, Michigan and went as a young girl to Paris to study the harp and remained there until she died in 1943.  She published several books, including <title render="italic">Margaret and The Singer's Story </title>(1888) and <title render="italic">Cirillo </title>(1903).  </p>
