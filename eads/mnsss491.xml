        <p>Choice USA was founded in 1992 by Gloria Steinem as Voters for Choice and serves to
   mobilize and provide ongoing support to the upcoming generation of leaders who promote and
   protect reproductive choice. The organization's first projects analyzed the activities of the
   religious right in elections and promoted electoral participation by women, young people, and
   people of color. In 1996, responding to signs that young people's support for reproductive
   choice had declined compared to previous generations and that young supporters of choice were
   disconnected from the pro-choice movement, Choice USA created the Next Generation Campaign which
   focused its work exclusively on teenagers and young people. National in scope, Choice USA's
   programs address the pressing need for pro-choice messages, programs, and strategies tailored to
   engage young people, whose experiences differ markedly (socially and politically) from the
   generation of reproductive rights activists who fought to see Roe v. Wade passed in 1973.  In
   2001, Choice USA laid the groundwork for transitioning to become an exclusively youth-led and
   youth-focused reproductive rights organization, creating programs that incorporate the lessons
   learned from research (and validated by field experience) to regain young people's support.
   Choice USA programs reach young people in every region of the country. Gloria Steinem currently
   serves as the President of the Board of Directors.  Crystal Plati is Executive Director.</p>
