       <p>Geraldine Rosenberg was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to a Zionist leader and his
wife on July 14, 1907.  She was a member of the Smith College class of 1929 but left college
in January of 1928 in order to marry Herman Stern.  She had two children before she divorced
her first husband in 1948.  Later she married Milton Wayne, a sculptor.  Stern lived in Los
Angeles for many years and wrote movie scripts.   In 1952 she moved to New York City  where
she used her experience to write television scripts.  From 1955-57 she lived in Paris and
studied painting with Joseph Hirsch and  Henri Gaoetz.   She has exhibited her artwork in Paris,
New York, and other cities and, after 1956, her paintings and barn-beam totems were
collected by both private and public collectors.  In addition to her journalistic writing for newspapers and magazines in the 1950s, Stern also wrote <title render="italic">Daughters from Afar: Profiles of Israeli Women</title> (1958); and <title render="italic">Israeli Women Speak Out </title>(1979) about Israeli women and feminism.</p>
