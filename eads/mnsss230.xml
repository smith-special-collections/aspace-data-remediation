       <p>Katharine Cornell (1893-1974) was born in Germany and raised in  Buffalo, New
York. She began her stage career with the Washington Square Players in New York City in
1916. In 1921, she married director, Guthrie McClintic, and in 1931, they formed the Cornell-

were the leads in "A Bill of Divorcement" (1921), "St. Joan" (1936), "Romeo and Juliet"(1933-
34), and "The Barretts of Wimpole St." and Candide" (1931-34). She toured European front-
