        <p>Helen Caldicott is a pediatrician and environmental activist.  In her native Australia, she  led successful campaigns to ban French atmospheric nuclear testing and uranium mining.  In the  U.S., she revived Physicians for Social Responsibility while an instructor at Harvard Medical  School and a fellow at Children's Hospital Medical Center. In 1980, she resigned to become a  full-time anti-nuclear activist. She helped found the Medical Campaign Against Nuclear War, and  the Women's Party for Survival, later called the Women's Action for Nuclear Disarmament (WAND),  then Women's Action for New Directions.</p>
