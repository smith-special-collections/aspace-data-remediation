     <p>Stop It Now! was founded in Northampton, Massachusetts, by Fran Worden Henry in 1992.  It is a national, public health based organization working to prevent child sexual abuse through education of adults, including people at risk for abusing and their families and friends, and to promote policy changes at the local and national level to support prevention strategies. Stop It Now! community-based programs currently exist across the country and in the United Kingdom and Ireland.  They have successfully tested the idea that when adults are given adequate information and resources they will act to prevent sexual abuse of children.</p>
