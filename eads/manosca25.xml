<p>Donna Kenny's portion of the project consist of interviews with fourteen members of the administration, faculty, and staff and a paper based on the interviews.  Many of these interviews are open for listening without restriction but in most cases permission from the interviewee is required before excerpts can be published in any way.
 Portions of Ms. Kenny's paper have been blocked out because she takes quotes from interviews that are restricted.
 Maureen Dooley Lawrence's portion of the project consists of four tapes of interviews with students participating in the occupation and a paper based on those interviews.  All of the student interviews and Ms. Lawrence's paper are closed until July 1, 1991.  At that time the tapes and paper will be made available with the names of the individuals removed.  </p>
