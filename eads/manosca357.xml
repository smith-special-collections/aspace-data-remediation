	<p>Jean Louise Burnham was born in Brooklyn, New York on November 20, 1916 to Leonard Preston Burnham and Mary Waterman Burnham.  Her family moved to Gloucester, Massachusetts during her childhood and she graduated from Gloucester High School in 1934.  A serious student, she edited and wrote for high school publications and was dubbed the "Class Genius" by her classmates.  She entered Smith College in 1934 and graduated in 1938, returning to Gloucester to work as a secretary for the Red Cross.  On June 6, 1942, she married Albert Robertson Gray, whom she had known since high school, while he was furloughed from the U.S. Army.  At the close of World War II in 1945, her husband returned to civilian life and she left her work as a secretary.  In 1948, she gave birth to a son, Thomas Leonard Gray.  He died in 1974.  The Grays lived in Haworth, New Jersey, moving to Sarasota, Florida in 1983.  She was active in the Northern Valley (N.J.) Smith College Club and in the local chapter of the American Association of University Women as well as in other women's clubs and church groups.  Jean Louise Burnham Gray died in Sarasota on February 26, 1984, after a period of illness.</p>

	<p>The Jean Louise Burnham papers contain correspondence and materials about her life and that of her husband that she preserved from the time she was fourteen years old until her death at age sixty-two.  The collection also contains some correspondence and photographs collected by her husband, Albert Robertson Gray, after her death.</p>

<p>The correspondence includes letters written by Jean to her mother during her first year at Smith College.  She relates many of her daily activities on and off campus and expresses concerns about her grades, performance in classes, weight, and finances.  A resident of Talbot House, she tried to earn income by baking and selling "cakes" to other girls and taking on clerical work.  A few letters reflect on her academic experience at Smith, which in this semester included history, hygiene, psychology and French. Others reflect on her personal religious beliefs and experiences.</p>

<p>The bulk of the collection consists of several hundred letters between Burnham and her husband, Albert Robertson Gray, between 1939 and 1945.  While the archive did not receive a truly double-sided correspondence, most of the letters it did receive had been carefully preserved in date order.  The collection contains letters from Al to Jean from 1939, when he was embarking on a business career after his graduation from Dartmouth, to early 1944, when he left for duty in Europe in the Finance Section of the 4th Infantry Division of the U.S. Army.   His early letters were written from various East Coast locations; after he was drafted in February, 1941, most were written from three U.S. Army bases:  Fort Dix, New Jersey, and Camp Gordon and Fort Benning, Georgia.  They contain considerable detail about the life of a sergeant on the base and about his work in the finance office.  Al wrote Jean one- to two-page letters about twice a week.</p>

<p>The bulk of Jean's letters to Al--which were generally much longer and more frequent--are from the period after he left for Europe in 1944.  Hers also relate many daily activities as well as her emotions during their long separation.  Many of Jean's are V-Mail (Victory mail) letters. Using forms available through the postal service, writers could write, fold, and send letters on a single sheet of paper.  These were then opened and microfilmed.  The microfilms were shipped overseas, taking up far less cargo space than actual letters would have.  Recipients received a photographic print of the original letter at one-quarter its original size.</p>

<p>Although the letters allow one to read only one side of the correspondence for each period, their conversational quality and emotional intensity provide indicators of Jean's and Al's distinct personalities.  Some letters also convey the practical problems of life in wartime--several letters from 1944 discuss their difficulty in obtaining a typewriter for Jean--and mention events in the wider world.  They make many references to current cinema, compare their reactions to a radio speech by Winston Churchill, and discuss the meaning and significance of the war.  Albert Gray's wartime correspondence file includes a small number of additional letters received from family and colleagues, most from 1945.</p>

<p>Additional materials of note include a scrapbook maintained by Jean circa 1934, an unpublished essay or speech regarding the founding of a women's club written sometime before her marriage, and a humorously written booklet of "15-year Statistics" created for the Class of 1938's 15th reunion.  Other items include clippings, a high school yearbook, and dance cards from the 1930s (in the scrapbook).</p>

<p>Among the dozens of photographs in this collection are a few taken on the Smith campus, including a print of an Ivy Day portrait of seven Class of 1938 graduates (including Jean Burnham) signed by Paul L. Anderson.</p>
