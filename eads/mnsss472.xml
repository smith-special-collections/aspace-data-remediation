       <head>Historical Note</head>
     <p>The Women's International Theatre Alliance (WITA) was founded to promote the work of women in the theatre, from playwrights to women's theatre groups to one-woman shows. An International Women's Theatre Festival was proposed to be held at Skidmore College in 1981, but never took place. The WITA dissolved in 1981.</p>
