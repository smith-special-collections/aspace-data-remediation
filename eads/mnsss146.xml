<daodesc><p>Frances Bemis, n.d.</p></daodesc></dao>
         <p>Frances Bemis was a public relations specialist,
    executive, writer, radio producer, and fashion director. She
    was born in Georgia on 25 June 1898, and she attended
    Oglethorpe University and the University of California. In
    the 1920s, she wrote columns for the Atlanta Constitution and
    Journal, and she started her public relations career by
    handling publicity for the Woman's Club of Atlanta. She
    accompanied her husband (probably Clarence Bemis) to New York
    City in the late 1920s, and it was there that she became a
    professional in the fields of public relations and
    advertising. (She used the name Frances Bemis professionally.
    She was married four times, but the names of her husbands and
    dates of the marriages are unknown). Hearn's, a Brooklyn
    Department Store that during the Depression declared itself
    "the bargain store of all the people," hired her as a fashion
    promoter and publicist in 1932. Bemis is responsible for
    numerous innovations in the field of department store
    publicity. She designed events that were guaranteed to garner
    press attention and bring crowds of entertainment-starved,
    Depression-Era New Yorkers to the free events at the store.
    She used celebrities and lavish shows with elaborate sets and
    costumes to promote new departments and features of the
    store, fashion collections, and holiday tie-ins. For example,
    in 1936-37, she staged a dog show, brought a psychologist to
    the store to counsel shoppers on their personal problems,
    hired legendary society woman Elsa Maxwell to emcee a fashion
    contest, and held a Thanksgiving Day circus in Central Park.
    In addition to writing scripts and coordinating production of
    these events, Bemis wrote lively releases for the press and
    radio. News of her events could often be found on the women's
    pages of New York papers, and occasionally, she made the
    front pages of the paper, as was the case when Mayor Fiorello
    LaGuardia opened ceremonies for Forgotten Man Day in 1934, a
    response to the National Recovery Act.</p>
         <p>In 1938, Bemis left Hearn's department store to do
    free-lance public relations work with the Claire Wolff
    Agency. Among other projects, she directed a "College Girl's
    Day" for the Ford Motor Company at the 1939 New York World's
    Fair and staged a "Fashions Out of Test Tubes" event for the
    chemical industry. Her husband, (first name unknown) McLain,
    had joined the Army air force, and Bemis enlisted in the
    Women's Army Auxiliary Corps in 1943. She was stationed in
    Daytona Beach, where she gave radio addresses and staged
    entertainment for GIs and WAACs. She achieved the rank of
    corporal and was given an honorable discharge upon the urging
    of New York Times editor Ivan Veit. The Times sought a
    director for a war-time fashion show intended to vaunt New
    York City as a fashion capital while Parisian fashion houses
    languished under German occupation. The result, Bemis's
    "Fashions of the Times," was an unqualified success.
    Spectators filled the show to capacity, and the publicity did
    much to promote American fashion.</p>
         <p>After the war, Bemis returned to Atlanta to become
    Director of Special Events at Rich's Department Store. She
    drew great press for her "Fashionata" show (1946-47), which
    used local socialites as models in a typically lavish
    production. In 1947, Bemis took a position as Director of
    Feature Events at New York City's Abraham and Strauss
    Department Store. She stayed at A and S until 1954 and
    continued her successful formula of spectacular events,
    luminous personalities, and innovative consumer services. Her
    personal interests in the fine arts, radio, and literature
    were reflected in several shows in which she showcased
    notable artists and performers, including Betty Smith (author
    of A Tree Grows in Brooklyn), the Met Opera's Rise Stevens,
    and radio and TV star Morey Amsterdam.</p>
         <p>In 1956, Bemis moved to St. Augustine, Florida for a
    retirement of sorts. Though she no longer staged fashion
    extravaganzas, she used her considerable creative energy for
    civic and charitable activities. She worked as a publicist
    for the city of St. Augustine, wrote for the local papers,
    volunteered at an art gallery, and took an interest in
    advocacy for civil rights and the mentally ill. She was
    murdered in November, 1974.</p>

         <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
         <p>The Frances Bemis Papers consist of 7 linear ft. of
    material from her professional career and date from 1933 to
    1974. Photographs make up the largest portion of the
    collection, but the Papers also include biographical
    information, correspondence, publicity, scripts, clippings,
    programs, and scrapbooks.</p>
         <p>The Papers detail Bemis's busy career over decades during
    which professional women were often a marginal part of the
    work-world. The documentary evidence of Bemis's innovative
    transformation of the staid department store exhibition into
    a headline-grabbing cavalcade indicates the often-overlooked
    influence of professional women in the mid-twentieth century.
    The Papers also illustrate the world of fashion in 1930s-50s
    New York City and give a window into the celebrity and
    consumer culture of this time.</p>
