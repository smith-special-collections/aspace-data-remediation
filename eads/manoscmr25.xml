	<p>Thomas Carlyle (December 4, 1795-February 5, 1881) was a Scottish writer and historian and widely influential on Victorian life and thought. He married Jane Welsh on October 17, 1826.</p>

<p>Jane Baillie Welsh (July 14, 1801-April 21, 1866) was the daughter of Dr. John Welsh and Grace Billie Welsh of Haddington, Scotland, where her father practiced medicine. Haddington is southeast of Edinburgh.</p>

<p>The marriage between Thomas Carlyle and Jane Welsh was a difficult one, although with her death he went into deep depression. In their married life they lived in various places in Scotland and on Cheyne Row, Chelsea, in London.</p>

<p>John Patrick (1830-1923) was a Scottish baker turned photographer. After maintaining photography studios in various towns in Scotland, he opened a shop in Edinburgh in May 1884 at 5 Coniston Road. Eventually his sons joined him in this enterprise. He first photographed Thomas Carlyle in 1874.</p>

    <scopecontent id="scope">
	
	<p>The Thomas and Jane Welsh Carlyle Photographs consist of photographs of Thomas' wife Jane Welsh Carlyle; three of them have his handwritten comments on the photographs. In addition, there are numerous photographs by John Patrick of Edinburgh of sites and residences associated with the Carlyles. There also is one holograph letter (1870) by Thomas Carlyle concerning an image to be reproduced in one of his books; this letter, although purchased with the photographs in this collection, is unrelated to them.</p>
