         <p>Twenty socially conscious women who wished to use their
    power as consumers to obtain justice for workers founded the
    League of Women Shoppers (LWS) in New York City in June 1935.
    By 1937, the New York group claimed thousands of members and
    established branches in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles,
    Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Newark, New Jersey, and
    Columbus, Ohio. Although the LWS was officially non-partisan
    and, according to its constitution, "non-political," many
    members, including Jessie Lloyd O'Connor, Lillian Hellman,
    and Freda Kirchwey, had ties to other progressive and labor
    organizations. The official purposes of the League were
    threefold: to investigate the working conditions in the
    stores they patronized and the factories that produced the
    goods they consumed; to educate and organize consumers to
    support union organizing and to press for better wages and
    working conditions for workers who produced goods and
    provided services; and to protect and improve American living
    standards through both grassroots actions, such as boycotts
    and buyers' cooperatives, and legal regulation, such as rent
    and price controls and the protection of wages. In keeping
    with its unofficial progressive bent and political agenda,
    the LWS also supported other social justice causes, including
    civil rights for African-Americans and equal pay for women
    workers.</p>
         <p>The Dies Committee branded the League of Women Shoppers a
    subversive organization in 1939. Nevertheless, League members
    continued to participate in a variety of consumer and union
    organizing campaigns through the early years of the 1940s.
    When the U.S. became formally involved in World War II, the
    League expanded its program to include efforts to support
    rationing and discourage black market sales of goods in short
    supply. In 1944, League members-whose numbers had decreased
    significantly from the late 1930s-worked for Franklin
    Roosevelt's reelection to a fourth term, but by 1945 the LWS
    engaged in fewer and fewer activities and soon faded out of
    existence.</p>

         <p>The League of Women Shoppers Records consist of .25 linear
    feet dating from 1937-2001. These materials are far from a
    complete archive of the organization, but rather a selection
    of materials collected by one member. The bulk of the records
    date from 1937 through 1945 and focus on the national office
    of the League and its Chicago branch, though there are also a
    few records from Columbus, Ohio, Washington, D.C., and
    Newark, New Jersey. The documents reveal the history of the
    League of Women Shoppers, its goals, and the activities it
    conducted to promote them. Types of materials include
    agendas, correspondence, minutes, notes, printed material,
    and testimony.</p>
         <p>Consumer education, union organizing, workplace
    conditions, and popular front activism are some of the major
    subjects addressed in the collection. The records offer
    insight into the goals and activities of a typical popular
    front-era progressive group that organized women on the basis
    of their roles as wives, mothers, and consumers and aimed to
    improve conditions for women and for the working-class as a
    whole. In addition to documenting the League of Women
    Shoppers itself, the papers document major twentieth century
    historical trends such as the achievements of the industrial
    union movement in the 1930s, and the increasing attention
    devoted to race and gender issues in U.S. politics during and
    after World War II.</p>
