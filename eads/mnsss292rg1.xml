The records consist of articles, fact sheets, theses, books, pamphlets, and manuscripts on the history of the YWCA of the U.S.A.; copies of the YWCA's charter, constitution and by-laws, and Purpose, with minutes, notes, and correspondence about various revisions; Annual Reports; general information about Committees, Councils, and Departments, including charters and rosters; organization charts; staff rosters and office/telephone directories.</p>

	<p>Many of the basic histories written by YWCA staff and members were among the last items filmed in Part 2c of the Subject Files and can be found under YWCA, History.  Annual Reports and Constitution and By-laws up to 1970 are also available on the microfilm.</p>

	<p>Most of the Microfilmed Records are also available in Original Format.  In addition to the post-1970 records on Constitution amendments, updates of the Purpose, and Annual Reports, there is also some more recent historical writing about the YWCA.

	<p>Historical information about the major administrative reorganizations can be found in the general Historical Note and in the Historical Notes for <extref href="mnsss292rg6_main.html">RECORD GROUP 6.  PROGRAM</extref>, and <extref href="mnsss292rg8_main.html">RECORD GROUP 8.  COMMUNITY ASSOCIATIONS</extref>.</p>
	<p>This series contains the major studies of the National Association administrative structure done by outside consultants and National Association Committees.   Generally, reorganizations were prompted by financial crises and the Association more often than not opted to implement some of the concepts, but did not adopt the recommendations wholesale.  In some cases, as in the Organizational Renewal  plan of the early 1970s, financial constraints prevented full application of the plan.  In addition to the studies there are minutes, reports, and working files of committees and commissions.</p>
	<p>The bulk of the records are related to the series of "redesign" and "strategic planning" efforts begun in the late 1980s that ultimately led to the major restructuring of the National Association in 1999-2000.  Included are many notes, reports, memoranda, surveys, and other materials from the Governance  Task Force (1988-92); Project Redesign (1992-93); Strategic Planning Initiative (1994-2000), and Change Initiative (1998-2000).</p>

	<p>This series contains general and historical materials; files on policies and practices related to individuals (as opposed to Community or Student Association's membership in the National Association); and publications and committee records related to the recruitment and development of new members.</p>
	<p>Included are records of the Basis Commission, 1913-19, charged with examining the requirement that YWCA members must be members of Evangelical Protestant churches; and the Corresponding Membership system, 1920-31, which allowed women who lived in regions of the country where there was no YWCA to join the National Association directly (as opposed to being members in the National by virtue of their membership in a Community or Student Association.)  Records of post-World War II membership committees are more likely to be concerned with definition of terms such as member, elector, and participant; fee structures; and the status of men and boys in YWCA programs. From the 1960s on, Association committees expended increasing energy on recruitment of new members.</p>

	<p>The Original Format Records are arranged in three sections:  General and History; Policies and Practices; and Recruitment and Development.  General and History consists of two theses written in 1951 and 1954 on  membership in the YWCA.  Policies and Practices includes forms, committee records, reports, studies, and publications.  Recruitment and Development contains committee records, publications, and records of the late 1980s "Why Double You?" membership campaign.  Most of the Original Format Records pre-1971 are also on the microfilm.</p>

	<p>The Anniversaries records consist of minutes, planning materials, programs and other publications, and publicity from various YWCA anniversaries, 1916-94. </p>
	<p>Documentation is especially rich for the "World YWCA Centennial" in 1955 (the centennial of the founding of the first proto-YWCAs in Great Britain-as opposed to the centennial of the organization, World YWCA) and the 135th Anniversary of the founding of the earliest U.S. Association in 1993-94.

	<p>The National Board Archives staff compiled files from a variety of sources, they include some of the people and items in the microfilmed files, but cover a wider date span and may include small amounts of personal correspondence and memorabilia donated to the YWCA Archives.  Most of the National Association's personnel files were discarded, but small amounts of surviving materials, such as personnel record cards and questionnaires, were incorporated into these Biographical Files by National Board Archives staff.</p>

	<p>Historical information about the YWCA of the U.S.A.'s work with staff of the YWCA in other countries can be found in the Historical Note for  <extref href="mnsss292rg5_main.html">RECORD GROUP 5.  INTERNATIONAL WORK</extref>. </p>
	<p>With the exception of the records related to the YWCA of  China, the historical files on "Foreign" YWCAs are small subject files consisting primarily of publications.  In some cases there are scrapbooks or photograph albums, usually presented to the YWCA of the U.S.A. or to one of its "Foreign" staff as part of a ceremonial occasion.  They are arranged alphabetically by country.</p>
	<p>The National Association's involvement with the YWCA of China dates back to the earliest days of the Association and included an unusually large number of American secretaries.  Because of this, the files related to the YWCA of China are especially rich.  In addition to brochures, reports, copies of minutes of the National Committee of the YWCA of China, financial records, and publications, there are a number of photograph albums donated to the YWCA Archives by American secretaries who served in China in the 1910s and 1920s.</p>

	<p>The Microfilmed Records have fairly extensive "reference" materials as part of the "Foreign" and "International" sections.  Unfortunately, reels 51 and 52 (China, American Staff, Correspondence and Reports, Brennecke - China, Property, Canton) were lost some years ago before transfer to the Sophia Smith Collection.</p>

	<p>The Original Format Records are arranged alphabetically by country.  Due to the large size and scope of the YWCA of China materials, they are filed separately at the end of the series.  Other larger files include those on the YWCA of Great Britain and the YWCA of India, Burma, and Ceylon, which contain copies of various serials put out by those Associations.</p>
