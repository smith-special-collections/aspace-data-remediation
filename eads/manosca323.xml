	<p>While Smith students participated in campus debates as early as 1900, the Smith College Debating Union (re-named the Smith College Debate Society in 1976) was officially sanctioned during the 1914-1915 academic year. The purpose of the organization was "to encourage the open communication of ideas and interests outside the classroom," to develop the students' researching and speaking skills, and to create a Smith team that could compete in intercollegiate debates. At the invitation of Vassar College in 1918, the Smith College Debating Union entered the intercollegiate debating field for the first time. These early debates were exceedingly popular among students, who showed support by appearing in large droves at each event. President Nielson commonly presided over the debates held at Smith. In 1929, the Smith College Debating Union participated in its first co-educational debate against Dartmouth College. The name of the organization was, unofficially, changed to the Smith College Debate Team/Club in 1932. Debates were held on various topics, ranging from "Resolved: that Smith and Yale Should be Co-Educational," to " Resolved: That Woman's Place is in the Home." Holding upwards of 80 debates annually, the Smith College Debate Society was exceedingly active and attracted a large number of members. While interest in the club waned at the end of the 1920s, the organization was re-vamped in the 1950s and increasingly picked up stamina. In 1991, two Smith College debaters placed 11th out of 140 teams at the World Debate Championships in Toronto and were the third-ranked American team behind two teams from Yale University.</p>
