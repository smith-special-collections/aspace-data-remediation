       <p>Dorothea de Schweinitz (1891-1980) was born in Nazareth, PA. She was the third child of Paul and Mary de Schweinitz. She attended the Moravian Parochial School and graduated from Smith College in 1912. Later she studied at the Universities of Wisconsin and Chicago and obtained her M.A. at Columbia University in 1929. She spent twenty years in employment and vocational guidance work in the YWCA in New York, in developing a Junior Employment Service in the public schools of Philadelphia, in the Industrial Research Department of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, and in assisting in the development of a demonstration office in Philadelphia of the Pennsylvania State Employment Service and in research in the U.S. Employment Service in Washington. During this period she wrote two books: <title render="italic">How Workers Find Jobs, A Study of 4,000 Hosiert Workers in Philadelphia</title> and <title render="italic">Occupations in Retail Stores</title>. She was president of the Philadelphia Vocational Guidance Association in 1924-25 and of the National Vocational Guidance Association in 1925-26. The next twenty years she spent in employer-labor relations as regional director of the National Labor Relations Board in St. Louis, chief of the Committee Standards Branch, War Production Board (an activity concerned with labor-management cooperation through joint production committees) with headquarters in Washington, and as an industrial relations specialist in the Wage Stabilization Board. After World War II she obtained a grant from the Wertheim Committee of Harvard University and in 1949 her book on the war period, <title render="italic">Labor and Management in a Common Enterprise</title>, was published by the Harvard University Press. In 1966 her book <title render="italic">Labor-Management Consultation in the Factory, the Experience of England, Sweden and Germany</title>, was published. This was the result of a year's independent research in the countries indicated. After retirement de Schweinitz gave her attention to the problems of Georgetown in Washington, D.C. She was instrumental in obtaining the 1950 "Old Georgetown" Act in which the U.S. Congress established Georgetown as a Historic District under the protection of the Commission of Fine Arts. She was also the moving spirit in forming Historic Georgetown, Inc., which rescued from demolition the Thomas Sim Lee buildings at 30th and M Streets. On 27 Feb 1974 de Schweinitz received a Smith College Medal.</p>

	<p>Dr. Louise de Schweinitz Darrow was born in Nazareth, PA, in 1898. A 1918 graduate of Smith College, she studied at Columbia University and received her medical degree from Johns Hopkins Medical School in 1924. She practiced medicine at Yale University and the community Health Well Baby Clinics in New Haven CT. and later was the examining physician and patient coordinator in the children's rehabilitation unit of University of Kansas Medical Center. She was active in community affairs. She died at the age of 99, April 3, 1997.</p>
