       <head>Historical Note</head>
     <p>According to oral historian Jerry Reynolds, who conducted the 60 interviews that comprise the
heart of this collection, "The Archival interviews and research on the Coalition of Indian
Controlled School Boards fill a gaping empty page in the contemporary annals of Indian Country, and
of America's social justice movement at large. The interviews contain a unique, otherwise
unknowable history. From before its official incorporation in 1971 to its demise in 1981, the
Coalition made unrivaled contributions to Indian parental and community control of Indian
education. In 1974, in <title render="italic">Education and the American Indian: The Road to Self-Determination Since
1928</title>, scholar Margaret Connell Szasz wrote, 'In its first year, the coalition provided technical
assistance in all aspects of education for Indian school boards, communities, and organizations,
and served as a clearing house for information on legislation and other matters pertaining to
Indian education. Less than two years after it was formed, CICSB was serving eighty-seven schools
and organizations.' In the same year, Vine Deloria Jr. put the case for the Coalition in still
stronger terms. Writing in 'The Indian Affair' that of the organizations forged to 'carry the fight
to the Bureau' after the Bureau of Indian Affairs' decision to outflank self-determination on the
battleground of educational programs and policies, Deloria states: 'The most important of these
[organizations] is the Coalition of Indian Controlled School Boards ... now working with over a
hundred local Indian school boards in trying to take over the education of reservation and urban
Indian children. The Coalition is the most efficient and sophisticated organization that Indian
country has ever seen and is far more capable than the Indian political groups ... in getting
changes made.'  Deloria went on to describe the Coalition's successful lawsuit against President
Richard M. Nixon's administration for the release of impounded Indian education funds. 'The
Coalition thus accomplished more for Indians in one lawsuit than the activists have by any of their
celebrated events, for the monies went directly into Indian controlled school districts and allowed
the reservation people to begin development of their educational institutions. The year after Szasz
and Deloria wrote their contemporary testimonials, the Coalition was the principal reason the '638'
law of 1975 is entitled 'The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act.'"</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
     <p>The collection includes interviews with individuals who made "unrivaled contributions to
Indian parental and community control of Indian education."  There are audio recordings,
transcripts (some partial), and abstracts of the oral histories; plus related correspondence,
memos, reports, newspaper articles, published and unpublished manuscripts, legal and government
documents. A large percentage of the interviews are with women and many who were involved in the
Indian rights movement, including Fanny LeMay and Rebecca Adamson who  was the first field
coordinator for the coalition. According to oral historian Jerry Reynolds, 46 of the 97
interviewees were women.  "Women played a decisive role in the Coalition's accomplishments both as
committed parents and political catalysts."  See finding aid for complete list of names and
