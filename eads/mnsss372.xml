       <p>The New Jersey Project on Inclusive Scholarship, Curriculum and Teaching was established by the State of New Jersey as the first statewide, state-funded gender and multi- cultural scholarship and curriculum project in the U.S.  Its diverse activities, which dealt with virtually all aspects of the learning experience, promoted and supported curriculum transformation and faculty/student development regarding issues of gender, race, ethnicity, class, culture, and sexuality. </p>

	<p>The Project published a journal, Transformations; sponsored ALANA, a support network for women of color in higher education in New Jersey; conducted conferences, workshops, and regional network meetings; held annual residential Summer Institutes for New Jersey college faculty; sponsored art exhibitions, poetry readings, and other special events; and made awards to students who demonstrated excellence in feminist scholarship during their undergraduate studies. </p>

	<p>In 1994, The New Jersey Project was awarded the national Progress in Equity Award from the American Association of University Women's Legal Advocacy Fund, and in 2001, the National Association for Multicultural Education honored the Project with its Multicultural Program Award. Paula Rothenberg served as Director of the New Jersey Project for many years.  The organization ceased operating in 2006.</p>
