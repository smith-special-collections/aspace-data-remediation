	<p>Norreys Jephson O'Conor was born in New York City on December 31, 1885, the son of John Christopher and Maria Jephson (Post) O'Conor.  He graduated from Harvard University (A.B., 1907 and M.A., 1911).  After working as an editor in various publishing companies, he taught in the English Department at Harvard (1911-1913) and at Radcliffe College (1918-1919).  He also taught at Grinnell College (1922-19230), Mount Holyoke College (1923-1924) and at Bryn Mawr College (1924-1926). </p>

	<p>O'Conor was known for his work on early Irish literature, as well as his own poetry and prose.  He worked in civil defense during World War II in California.</p>  
	<p>O'Conor married Grace Edith Corson, in Cambridge, Mass., on June 27, 1917.  They had two daughters, Moria and Cathleen.  Following his divorce from Grace in 1935, he married Evangelia Hawley in the same year.  He died in Santa Barbara, California on October 24, 1958.</p>  
	<p>See: <title render="italic">National Cyclopedia of American Biography</title>, v. 37, p. 391.  </p>
	<p>Grace Hazard graduated from Smith College, Class of 1899.  She studied music and studied in Europe before her marriage to Roscoe Platt Conkling in 1905.

Besides her teaching responsibilities, she wrote poetry and short stories that were published in the popular journals of the day.  She died on November 15, 1958. </p>

 <note><p>O'Conor begins by expressing regrets that he was not given the task of reviewing her new book of verse, <title render="italic">Wilderness Songs</title>, for <title render="italic">The Transcript</title>. Another individual was given that responsibility. He mentions that he received a letter in praise of Mrs. Conkling's poetry from Abbie Brown. Then he writes that he read two of his poems to Amy Lowell, including the poem "On the Death of an Old Irish Butler" that he had sent to Mrs. Conkling in draft. Miss Lowell had liked them both.

 <unittitle>Letter, 1922 Oct. 23, Grinnell College, Grinnell, Iowa [to] Mrs. Conkling.</unittitle>

 <note><p>O'Conor praises Hilda Conkling's latest book of verse, <title render="italic">Shoes of the Wind</title>, though he acknowledges he prefers her <title render="italic">Poems of a Little Girl</title>. He was not able to review this latest book as he is now teaching at Grinnell College to replace an "absent professor." O'Conor is teaching three sections of advanced composition, as well as a course in the short story and one in the writing of verse. This is not apt to leave him much time for his own writing. He also hopes that Mrs. Conkling has received a copy of his book, <title render="italic">Battles and Enchantments</title>. He gives his home address as: 1415 Broad Street.</p></note>

He provides potential travel details to Mrs. Conkling for a visit to Grinnell College, as she is coming west. He tells her of his appointment for the coming fall at Mount Holyoke College and is "greatly looking forward &amp;#8230; to being in the East again." He also notes the eminent arrival of either a "brother or a sister for Moria, who is clamoring for a companion." Grace, his wife, is in Des Moines awaiting the birth. Moria has had scarlet fever, so they are all quarantined. </p></note>

 <physdesc>[3] p. </physdesc>
 <note><p>Apparently Mrs. Conkling had been scheduled to visit the O'Conors at their London address, but circumstances prevented her from coming. The children were disappointed. He writes of his work on his "Elizabethan book" and that newly uncovered material has prolonged his work on it. However, "it will be all the better for the book." He tells something of the life the children are enjoying and their life at Edwardes Square. Also he sends congratulates to Elsa, Mrs. Conkling's daughter, who has "decided upon the Scandinavian after all!" </p></note>
