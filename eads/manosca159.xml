<bioghist id="bioghist">

<p>Paul Robert Lieder was born on September 18, 1889 in Brooklyn, New York to William J.A. and Agnes Betz Lieder.  He attended Harvard University, where he earned his B.A. in 1910, his M.A. in 1912, and his PhD in 1915.  While studying to gain his PhD, he worked as an instructor of modern languages at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1912-1915).  In 1915 he came to Smith College as an instructor in English.  In 1917, Lieder was appointed assistant professor at Smith.  He also worked as a lecturer at Mount Holyoke in 1920, and from 1922 to 1923.  In 1925 he gained full professorship at Smith College.  In this same year, he joined the faculty of the summer school at Columbia University.  Working with Robert M. Lovett of Chicago University and Robert K. Root of Princeton, Lieder authored British Poetry and Prose originally published in 1928 and revised in 1938.  His research centered on English drama of the Restoration Period, as well as English poetry of the 19th century, Icelandic Literature, and the Scandinavian influence on 19th century English Literature.  While at Smith, Lieder taught courses such as "Drama from 1660 to the present" and a Literary Criticism course for seniors.  During his lifetime he was a member of many prestigious societies, including Phi Beta Kappa, the Modern Language Association of America, the American Dialect Association, and served as president of the Northampton Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.  Lieder retired from the Smith faculty in 1954, and was named a professor emeritus, an appointment which lasted until his death on May 14, 1956.</p>
