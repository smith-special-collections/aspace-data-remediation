	<p>The Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) was first introduced in the U.S. Congress in 1923. It was introduced in every session of Congress after that for nearly half a century. In 1971 the House of Representatives approved the proposed amendment. The Senate approved the amendment a year later.  The issue was sent to the state legislatures and twenty states ratified the ERA almost immediately (Alaska, Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, West Virginia, and Wisconsin). In 1973 Connecticut, South Dakota, Oregon, Minnesota, New Mexico, Vermont, Washington, and Wyoming ratified; Nebraska voted to rescind its ratification. Over the next few years, Maine, Montana and Ohio voted to ratify and Tennessee voted to rescind. In an effort to gain the additional three votes necessary for ratification, groups with many pro-ERA supporters boycotted states that had failed to ratify the Amendment. As the deadline for ratification loomed (22 March 1979), Representative Elizabeth Holtzman (D-NY) introduced a bill to extend the deadline for ratification. In October of 1978, Congress set a new deadline for the ERA--30 June 1982. In 1980 Ronald Reagan became the first president since the Equal Rights Amendment was sent to the states to oppose the ERA.  On 30 June 1982 the ERA died, falling three states short of the necessary three-fourths ratification. </p>

<p>Beth Leopold worked on the National Organization for Women (NOW) campaign to ratify the ERA. After its defeat, she sought to ensure that the story of the fight for ratification would be preserved and began the Equal Rights Amendment Campaign Archives Project (ERACAP). The goal of the ERACAP was to "collect and process oral history and photographic materials relating to the ERA campaign between the years 1970 and 1982." The focus of the collecting was on the experiences of participants in the local, state, and national levels of the campaign.
</p>
<p>The aim of the original project was to interview 150-200 people involved in the pro or anti-ERA work using archival quality open reel audiotape and to make typed transcripts of the interviews. There were also plans to create an index of the subjects covered in the interviews, along with photographs and a directory for additional materials related to the ERA campaign. Because funding for the project ran out in 1984, the oral history interviews were never created; however, Beth Leopold acted as intermediary between the Sophia Smith Collection and two documentary filmmakers to house their tapes and accompanying printed matter within the ERACAP collection.  "<title render="italic">Who Will Protect the Family?</title>" was completed and aired on PBS in 1982.  "<title render="italic">Fighting for the Obvious</title>" (Virago Video, 1982) was also completed, but it is uncertain whether it was shown by a major media outlet. In addition, Leopold's own ERA-related material came with the ERACAP materials.</p>

	<p><title render="italic">WHO WILL PROTECT THE FAMILY?</title></p>

	<p>This footage is from the 1982 hour-long PBS documentary that examines both sides of the ERA fight in North Carolina. According to the official press release from the filmmaker, Victoria Costello, Who Will Protect the Family? "is an intimate, personal, political chronicle of the last three years [1979-1982] in the controversial struggle in North Carolina between the political organizations and individual activists of the conservative, born-again, Christian political movement, and the liberal women's movement." </p>
	<p>Reporter Frances Fitzgerald is a Pulitzer Prize-winning author, and Victoria Costello is an independent video producer based in Washington, D.C. Together, they gained behind-the-scenes access to political meetings, lobbying efforts, and the workplaces and homes of those involved in both sides of the struggle. The central focus of the documentary is the "evolving lives of two North Carolina activists," Beth McAllister, a feminist, and Marilyn DeVries, a conservative Christian. Other footage includes a Christian high school graduation, the first pro-ERA march ever held in North Carolina; a Father's Day service at the church of Reverend Lamarr Mooneyham, the Chairman of North Carolina's Moral Majority; a Father's Day picnic, organized by Black feminists in the Black community of Raleigh; and several personal confrontations between conservative and feminist movement members and leaders. 
</p>
<p>* In addition to these footage excerpts, the Sophia Smith Collection also has a copy of the documentary in its entirety. </p>

		<p>Beth Leopold's work at the National Organization for Women is documented in this series. Media projects played a large role in NOW's efforts to pass the ERA in the fifteen states where it hadn't yet passed. The ERA Countdown campaign materials include photocopies of images dating back to the early twentieth century that were selected for a film to document the struggle for the ERA, with the bulk of the images covering the 1970s and early 1980s. Other media-related projects for NOW can be found in the materials related to the Legal Defense and Education Fund.  This series also covers several major marches and rallies for the ERA. The Capitol March for ERA focuses mostly on Chicago, where Leopold directed her energies. This series also includes subject files, memorabilia, and a bibliography of newspaper clippings from the <title render="italic">New York Times</title> related to the ERA from 1970 through 1982.

		<p>This series is composed of the administrative and subject files of Victoria Costello, the director for <title render="italic">Who Will Protect the Family?</title>, an hour length color PBS documentary that examines the motivations, beliefs, and larger goals of the two movements fighting for and against the Equal Rights Amendment, focusing in particular on anti-ERA activist, Marilyn DeVries. And pro-ERA activist, Beth McAllister. Although the documentary specifically focuses on the three year battle to pass the ERA in North Carolina, the materials in this series relate to legislation, statistics, and organizations on both the state and national levels, as well as subjects that extend beyond the Equal Rights Amendment. Only a few transcripts from the film footage are in the collection; nevertheless, the few that exist provide valuable insight into the motivations of individuals fighting for and against the passage of the amendment, as do the brief summaries of selected footage in the Appendix.
