         <abstract encodinganalog="520$a" label="Abstract:">The records of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America provide substantial information about the history of the birth control and family planning movement nationally and internationally. They are a significant source of information on all aspects of the history of birth control and family planning, including women's health issues; sex education; women in poverty; international population planning and policy; and the legal, political and social aspects of contraception and abortion. Types of material include correspondence; memoranda; minutes; reports; financial records; legal records; publicity; publications; photographs; audio tapes; video tapes; and posters. The PPFA Records are divided into two portions, PPFA I and PPFA II, this being  section II.  The earlier records in <extref href="mnsss128_main.html">PPFA I</extref> are completely organized and open to research. PPFA II consists of records received since 1988, dating from the 1920s to the present, so there is some overlap in dates. This portion is unprocessed, and some parts are restricted (see Terms of Access and  Use below). </abstract>

         <p>In 1921 Margaret Sanger founded the national lobbying organization, American Birth Control League (ABCL) which in 1942 became Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA).  Between 1921 and 1942 the organization underwent two transformations.  In 1923 Sanger opened the Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau (BCCRB) for the purposes of dispensing contraceptives under the supervision of licensed physicians and studying their effectiveness.  The ABCL  provided institutional backing for clinics.  The BCCRB merged with the ABCL in 1939 to form the Birth Control Federation of American (BCFA).  In 1942 the name of the BCFA was changed to the Planned Parenthood Federation of America.</p>
		 


         <p>The name change reflected a redefinition of the organization's goals from family limitation to family planning.  While PPFA continued to function as the largest birth control organization in the country, it sought to position itself as a more mainstream and moderate organization committed to a broad range of programs related to reproductive health.  Under the leadership of National Director D. Kenneth Rose, the PPFA expanded its programs and services through the 1940s, adding affiliate organizations throughout the country.  By the end of World War II, the Federation was no longer solely a center for birth control services or a clearing house for contraceptive information but had emerged as a major national health organization.  PPFA's programs included a full range of family planning services, including marriage education and counseling, and infertility services.  The leadership of the PPFA, largely consisting of businessmen and male physicians, endeavored to incorporate its contraceptive services unofficially into regional and national public health programs by emphasizing less politicized aspects such as child-spacing.  During the 1950s, the Federation further adjusted its programs and message to appeal to a family-centered, more conservative post-war populace, while continuing to function, through its affiliated clinics, as the most reliable source of contraceptives in the country.</p>
         <p>From 1942 to 1962, PPFA concentrated its efforts on strengthening its ties to affiliates, expanding public education programs, and improving its medical and research work.  By 1960, visitors to PPFA centers across the nation numbered over 3,000,000 per year.</p>
         <p>In the 1950s PPFA began focusing greater attention on global population issues as new concerns arose over the political, social, and cultural implications of overpopulation in Asia and around the world.  The organization became active in international birth control work through its membership in the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF), which Margaret Sanger helped found in 1952.  In 1961 the population crisis debate, along with funding shortages, convinced PPFA to merge with the World Population Emergency Campaign, a citizens' fund-raising organization, to become PPFA-World Population.  Later in the 1960s, after several decades of emphasizing a family-centered, more conservative program for public health, PPFA reasserted its primary commitment to championing women's reproductive rights. It was also in the 1960s that family planning began to win the support of the federal government.  Alan Guttmacher, M.D., who served as president of PPFA from 1962 until his death in 1974, was an effective advocate for the idea of a woman's right to safe and effective birth control.  He successfully fought for the development of federally funded domestic and international family planning programs.  Guttmacher also played an important role in the development of the birth control Pill and IUD.  The Alan Guttmacher Institute (AGI) was named in his honor.  AGI is an independent corporation for research, policy analysis, and public education on reproductive health issues and is a special affiliate of PPFA.</p>
         <p>In 1970, Congress enacted Title X of the Public Health Services Act, providing support and funding for family planning services and educational programs and for biomedical and behavioral research in reproduction and contraceptive development.  The Family Planning International Assistance division was established in 1972 by PPFA, becoming the largest U.S. nongovernmental provider of family planning services to developing countries.</p>
         <p>In 1978, Faye Wattleton was appointed the first woman president of PPFA since Margaret Sanger.  She led PPFA in its ongoing battle to preserve access to safe and legal abortion, to protect client confidentiality, especially for minors, against encroachments by the state, and to preserve federal funding for domestic and international family planning programs.  By the time she retired from PPFA in 1992, Wattleton had greatly expanded its program of advocacy around the idea that sexual and reproductive liberation is central to women's equality.</p>
         <p>In the 1980s and 90s, PPFA faced an onslaught of opposition to family planning and birth control. The organization challenged regulations passed under the administrations of Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush that placed restrictions on U.S. funding of family planning services overseas and domestically. Organized right-wing opposition and violence against birth control and abortion providers also became a serious concern. PPFA continues to confront this opposition while it also addresses the public health issues surrounding sexuality and reproduction, such as the AIDS epidemic and the effect of poverty on families and children. Gloria Feldt currently serves as president of Planned Parenthood.</p>

         <p>The records of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America are divided into two sections, PPFA I and PPFA II, this being section II.  <extref href="mnsss128_main.html">PPFA I</extref> consists of the earlier records of the Federation (1918-74) and is completely organized and open to research. PPFA II consists of the central files of PPFA from the 1950s through 1981, with scattered earlier items dated as early as 1921, so there is some overlap in the dates. Miscellaneous accessions received from miscellaneous departments from 1988 through the 1990s are also included in a separate list following the central files. PPFA II records are unprocessed; the original order established by PPFA has been retained. For ease of access, restricted materials (1975 to the present and selected earlier records) have been segregated from those that are open to research (see Information on Use).  The inventory lists both open and closed materials.  The bulk of post-1974 publications are open.  Researchers may have access to closed records only if they obtain PPFA's permission.  The records, in categories established by the central offices, are organized into ten series, including Chronological files, Classified files, Publications, Subject files, Affiliates, Regions, Minutes, Foreign, Guttmacher, and Restricted.</p>
         <p>These records document the work of PPFA nationally and internationally in the areas of advocacy; medical services and research; legislation; public relations; and the specific work of affiliates, departments, and committees. Types of materials include correspondence, reports, minutes, memos, publicity, publications and other printed material, audiotapes, reference files, and  financial and legal material.</p>
         <p>The PPFA filing system was designed to suit the organization's internal operations and presents complications for the researcher. The classification system used by PPFA is sometimes not very descriptive and obscures the nature of the material. Related material may be located in several places. Divider headings, listed in bold caps, have been retained in the box list, but their relationship to nearby material is inconsistent and not always clear.</p>

        of outgoing correspondence, the bulk of which is from the
        national office, 1960s-70s. It is arranged alphabetically by
        the last name of the author of the letter. Each individual's
        correspondence is arranged in reverse chronological order. The
        authors of this correspondence include many significant PPFA

        administration of PPFA. It consists of records of the board of
        directors, executive committee, standing and special
        committees, and the various divisions and departments of the
        Federation. The records include correspondence, memos, by-laws,
        procedures, standards, press releases, reports, statistics,
        reference materials, and minutes. This series is the core
        record of Federation activities and policy development.</p>
               <p>The series is roughly arranged as follows:
        general policies and histories; committees, bylaws, and
        handbooks; annual meetings; administrative staff; and then
        departments and related organizations. Major departments and
        organizations are as follows: Center for Family Planning
        Program Development (which was called the Alan Guttmacher
        Institute beginning in 1975); Community Affairs (later known as
        Youth and Student Affairs); Field Department, which includes
        material on abortion; Financial Management; Communications (at
        times known as Education, Information and Education, or Public
        Affairs Department); Fund Raising/Resources; Medical (includes
        material on abortion and contraception); Research (includes
        clinic statistics); Family Planning International Assistance
        (includes reports on international family planning projects);

               <p>The bulk of this series is arranged
        alphabetically by title. Much of this material is published by
        PPFA and written by its staff. Many items are reprints from a
        variety of journals and newspapers. Some are miscellaneous
        reprints or are written by outside organizations and authors.
        The publications cover a variety of topics of interest to PPFA,
        such as abortion, population, contraceptives, marriage
        counseling, and poverty as it relates to population. There are
        legal briefs, bibliographies, and catalogs as well as articles,
        pamphlets, and books. Two boxes at the end are arranged
        alphabetically by author, and one box has no discernible
        order.</p>

               <p>The files in this series relate to
        organizations, individuals, conferences, grants, and a variety
        of topics of interest to PPFA, such as contraceptives. The
        materials, which include correspondence and printed material,
        are arranged in one alphabetical sequence. Note that there are
        inconsistencies in the filing system; for example conference
        files appear under "C," but files related to the National
        Conference on Social Welfare are under "N". The Abortion subject files are located in Accession 01S-42. Major
        subject categories include Associations and agencies (outside
        organizations), Conferences, Contraceptives, Foundations and
        Funds, Grant applications and proposals, Alan Guttmacher, and
        U.S. Government. Researchers are encouraged to check their
        topics alphabetically and to check under all pertinent
        headings. A box of material pertaining to Margaret Sanger
        follows the alphabetical files. It contains miscellaneous
        biographical material, publications, and
        correspondence.</p>

               <p>This series contains the national office's
        records on affiliate activities and includes minutes,
        affiliation materials, copies of correspondence, clippings,
        publicity, reports, and financial material.</p>
               <p>The bulk of the material is arranged
        alphabetically by state. The first set of state material is
        local affiliates' minutes. This is followed by minutes and
        meeting material from regional offices; it is unclear whether
        this duplicates material contained in SERIES VI. REGIONS. Next
        comes general administrative material, which includes files on
        services offered by affiliates, including birth control methods
        and sexually transmitted disease education. The remainder of
        material, the bulk of this series, is from affiliate offices
        and filed by state. General state programs such as anti-poverty
        and migrant worker programs are filed first within a state, and
        then local and metropolitan affiliates are listed. Files
        include affiliate reports, statistics, publicity, and
        correspondence. There are some inconsistencies: New York City
        comes before New York State, but there is also New York City
        material within New York State and some at the end of the
        series. The state of Connecticut is filed last. It contains a
        significant amount of information regarding Griswold vs.
        Connecticut and the fight to disseminate birth control and
        contraceptive information. The New York State files contain
        some material pertaining to the relaxation of abortion laws in
        the early 1970s. The end of the series includes miscellany and
        histories of the regions.</p>
