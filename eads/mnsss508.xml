<bioghist id="bioghist">
       
     	<p>Sarah Minona Stearns was born in Abington, Massachusetts, the daughter of Catherine Miller
Guild and Isaac Holden Stearns (1825-1897), physician and surgeon with 22nd Massachusetts Infantry
during the Civil War.  She attended New England public schools and Oak Grove Seminary in
Vassalboro, Maine, and completed her education at Milwaukee (Wisconsin) Female College. She studied
medicine, and assisted her father in the Milwaukee National Soldiers' Home, where he was a surgeon.
 She married Robert Clarence Fitts of Leverett, Massachusetts in 1879.  The couple had two
children: Roy Field Fitts (1881-1961) and Minona Louise Fitts (Thompson) (1887-1976). Beginning in
1892, Fitts opened the Mitchell Heights Millinery Store. It was also around this time that she
began to take an active interest in suffrage, women's rights, prison reform, and labor rights, and
began attending political gatherings and giving voice to her own political opinions via lecturing
and writing.  In the mid-1890s, she organized the Milwaukee Equal Suffrage Association and the
Waukegan Association, and served as president of both; was elected secretary to the Federal
Suffrage Association; and in 1896 was appointed delegate to the 29th Annual Convention of the
National American Woman Suffrage Association.  She also served as National President of the Race
Betterment League, founded the No Vote No Tax League, authored the Woman's Declaration of
Independence, and founded the Woman's Good Roads Movement in Illinois.  In 1897, she left what had
become an unhappy marriage and devoted all her attention to her political interests (the children
were raised by relatives).  The same year, upon the death of her father,  she  successfully took
over advocacy for Civil War veterans through his pension claims business.  It was also around this
time that she met Frank Warren Jones, whom she married in 1905.  Jones remained politically active
throughout her life.  In 1923, she moved to Spokane, Washington in order to be closer to her son
and his family. Jones died in Spokane in 1926.</p>
