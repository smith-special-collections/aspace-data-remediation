<daodesc><p>Ris&#235; Stevens, 1913-2013</p></daodesc></dao>
       <p>Ris&#235; Stevens was born in New York City on June 11, 1913.  She studied at Julliard and Mozarteum, Salzburg, working with Anna Schoen-Rane and Vera Schwartz.  She had her debut in Prague and returned to the US for her first appearance at the Metropolitan Opera in 1938.
She married Walter Surovy in 1939 and had one son, Nicholas. Until her retirement in 1961,
"she virtually owned many of the great mezzo[-soprano] roles" in classic opera.   During
World War II, she traveled with the Hollywood Victory Caravan.  She was a regular performer
on both radio and television and recorded for both Columbia and RCA Victor.  After her 1961
retirement from performing, Stevens continued her involvement in opera as director of the
Met's National Company, "dedicating to taking opera to hundreds of American cities where
opera was not available."  She later served as president of Mannes College of Music (1975-
78) and returned to the Met as director of its National Council Auditions (1980-88).  She
established the Ris&#235; Stevens scholarship at Adelphi College. Ris&#235; Stevens has been honored many times over her long career including honorary degrees from Russell Sage (H.H. D.), Hobart, and Smith Colleges (Mus. D.). Stevens passed away on March 20, 2013.</p>
