     <p>Safe Passage (formerly Necessities/Necesidades) was founded in Northampton, Massachusetts  in
1978 as a women's collective intended  "to empower women by providing them with self-help
techniques that allow them to end abusive relationships."  In addition to this work, the
organization also educates the community about violence against women through public programs and
publications and by training volunteers. Perhaps most important, it provides shelter and assistance
to battered women and their children.  In 1995 the organization abandoned its collective framework
in favor of a more hierarchical organizing structure that included  two co-directors and an
expanded board.  In 1998 they adopted a single director model.  In 2000, Necessities/Necesidades
changed its name to Safe Passage.</p>
